<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This WeTransfer clone was created as part of an assignment for the University subject **WWW Technologies** on the 4th Semester of [CS Dept., University of Thessaly][CSUTH].

It is free to use under GNU-GPLv3 license and anyone wanting to can experiment and improve upon our implementation.

You can have a look at [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/) and even use their services, or have a look at our own Frankenstein implementation at [MeTransfer.tk](http://metransfer.tk/).

### Built with
 - [PHP](https://www.php.net/index.php)
 - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
 - [Composer - A Dependency Manager for PHP](https://getcomposer.org/)
 - [Phinx - PHP Database Migrations For Everyone](https://phinx.org/)
 - And an innumerable amount of love :heart:
 


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have **installed PHP, MySQL & Composer**. (We assume you already use XAMPP, WAMPP or a similar service.)
2. Create a **MySQL user** and a **MySQL Database**.
3. Configure:
   1. **Phinx**:
      1. Rename `phinx.default.yml` to `phinx.yml`.
      2. Setup your Development (**Required**).
      3. (*Optional, but recommended*) Setup Testing & Production databases.
   2. **Project Configuration**:
      1. Go to `private_html` folder.
      2. Rename `config.default.ini` to `config.ini`.
      3. Configure the Database & other settings accordingly.
4. Run `composer install`.
5. And that's it!
6. (*Optional*) You can setup a **VirtualHost** & **Fake (local) Domain**. Instructions similar to [this thread](https://www.cloudways.com/blog/configure-virtual-host-on-windows-10-for-wordpress/).
7. (*Optional*) Setup a CronJob (for `public_html/cleanup_expired.php`) from your website hosting to cleanup user uploaded files when their time expires. If you chose not to have a cronjob, files are deleted when a user attempts to download an expired file. To learn more about cronjobs you could read [this thread](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/scheduling-tasks-with-cron-jobs--net-8800).



<!-- Usage -->

### File Structure Explanation
#### db folder:
This folder **contains all migrations** (Overly Simplified, Portable instructions to build MeTransfer's Database) generated by Phinx.

To read more about Migrations check out [this thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration) and [phinx docs](http://docs.phinx.org/en/latest/).


#### private_html folder:
This folder contains all things that shouldn't be visible to the client. Usually called "backend", this folder contains **Scripts**, **CronJobs**, **Mail Functions**, **Website Templates** and all our **Sensitive Information**.

This folder **MUST NOT BE VISIBLE** to any end-user.

**If you are sharing such a folder**, make sure to **remove any personal credentials**, such as the `config.ini` and replace it with a more generic `config.default.ini`.


#### public_html folder:
This folder contains **all publicly accessible urls & objects**, such as the **Index** (main page), **Download Page**, **Assets** (icons/css/js/plugins), and the **Admin & User Page**.

They do contain some minimal code logic too, but usually stuff about what to execute from private_html's codebase after a form is submitted.


#### sessions folder:
This folders contains **all user sessions**, which is files that keep user-preferences, status such as logged in, username e.t.c.

We use cookies to handle sessions and authenticate users.

To read more about Sessions and cookies see [this thread](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-is-the-difference-between-session-and-cookies).


#### uploads folder:
This folder contains all files uploaded by users. They are periodically cleaned using a CronJob (`cleanup_expired.php`) which you must setup. A **normal user should not have access to this location**, thus it is **outside of public_html**. 

Files are downloaded using a friendly-name generated url.
