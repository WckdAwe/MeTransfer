1
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,370
Someone once said, "We don't
stop playing because we grow old.

2
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,913
"We grow old because we stop playing."

3
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:46,957
When you're a kid, you can't imagine
having any other group of friends.

4
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,041
You think you're gonna be
buddies forever.

5
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:52,216
Of course, for most people,
that just doesn't happen.

6
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:57,134
But my friends and I,
we figured out a way around that.

7
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,182
We just never stopped playing.

8
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:04,020
And I like to think that simple thing,
playing a game,

9
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:07,644
is what made me the man I am today.

10
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,772
So the man you are today
wants to be a janitor.

11
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,399
Yes.

12
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,410
Look, Doctor Malloy,
I'm looking at your résumé.

13
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,533
It says you got a PhD
in veterinary medicine

14
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,410
and that you actually
have a successful practice right now.

15
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:28,669
Look, there comes a time
in every man's life

16
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,455
where you just gotta take stock,

17
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:34,876
ask yourself what's really important,
what's on your bucket list.

18
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:37,386
So let me get this straight.

19
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:41,591
On your bucket list, you don't have,
like, skydiving or rock climbing,

20
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,050
or tap dancing, maybe?

21
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,351
Dancing with wolves,

22
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,803
I believe that has to be a thing.

23
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,513
They wouldn't have made a movie
if it wasn't, you know?

24
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:51,192
All I know is that, for me,
what I really want

25
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:57,232
is to clean the urine off
of that man's toilet seat.

26
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:58,733
Talking about the boss.

27
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,486
Mr. Callahan.

28
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,154
Yeah, he's a great man.
This is a great company.

29
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,037
Anything I can do
to get closer to that guy, sign me up.

30
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,951
Okay, look, man.

31
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,665
Honestly, any other situation,

32
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,963
I would just tell you
to get the fuck out my office, okay?

33
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,714
But we do need the help,
so when can you start?

34
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,345
I've already begun.

35
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,596
What the fuck was that?

36
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,686
- Uh...
- I haven't even opened that yet.

37
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,685
Uh, I'm sorry.
I was trying to be proactive.

38
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,146
Today. I can start today. Um...

39
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,770
Why don't I get you another Coke?

40
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,480
- You do that, we good.
- Okay.

41
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,315
But don't throw away no more new stuff.

42
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,324
You will not be disappointed.

43
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,659
We don't have to shake hands, man.

44
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,828
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Sure.

45
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:47,998
White people.

46
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,340
All right, Bob. You're the CEO
of a Fortune 800 company.

47
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,885
You have commanded the respect
of coworkers and vendors alike,

48
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,884
and that is why you're being interviewed
by the big boys.

49
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,341
The Wall Street Journal.

50
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:10,684
- Miss Crosby.
- Oh. Hi.

51
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,598
- Hi. Bob Callahan.
- Rebecca.

52
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,979
Thank you so much
for taking the time.

53
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,233
On, thank you.

54
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,982
Should we just get right into it?

55
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:19,563
- Yeah, let's jump right in.
- All right.

56
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,116
Well, here's what I would love for your
readers to know about our company.

57
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,404
We are young.

58
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,736
We are dynamic. We are fun.

59
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,660
Uh, so let's talk about diabetes.

60
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,458
Mr. Callahan,
how do you respond to the idea

61
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,832
that your industry
uses captive insurance

62
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,333
to move risk off balance sheets?

63
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,921
Well, great question. Tough, but fair.

64
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:45,382
Um, I guess I would say that
what I love about Freedom Atlantic

65
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,637
is that we're not like
other insurance companies.

66
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:51,938
Uh, we're big, but small.

67
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,222
Uh... Small.

68
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,020
We are, um...

69
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,351
You know, we're complex...

70
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,695
...and yet, also simple.

71
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:04,658
And we are global...

72
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,158
Yet local.

73
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,534
That's exactly right.

74
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,614
Sorry, one second.

75
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,201
Uh, hey, could you maybe come back
at another time?

76
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,831
We're just right in the middle
of something. Sir?

77
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,334
I'm afraid not, Bob.

78
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,165
Jesus Christ, Hoagie!

79
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,500
What are you doing here?

80
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:22,585
How did you get past security?

81
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,295
I didn't. I work here.

82
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,807
You got a job at my company,
so you could try to tag me?

83
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,384
Come on. Bob, it's over.

84
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,641
You don't think I can escape
from my own conference room?

85
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:33,846
Where are you gonna go?

86
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,523
Well, guess what? Watch now
'cause this is happening.

87
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,815
- God dang it!
- Okay.

88
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,151
- Oh... Ouch.
- You okay?

89
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,611
God. Okay.

90
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:45,775
You're right.

91
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,192
It's over.

92
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,579
- Well, you're it.
- Yeah, I know. All right.

93
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,373
It's good to see you.
Good to see you, pal.

94
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,700
- Good to see you.
- Have you lost weight?

95
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,628
Yeah, a little bit.
Hey, listen, this is serious. Um...

96
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,455
Jerry's quitting.

97
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,584
What? Bullshit.

98
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,966
I swear to God.
End of this season, he's retiring.

99
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:07,547
Well, okay. But, uh, lam in the middle
of an interview. So can I...

100
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,973
- Wall Street Journal, that's so cool!
- Oh, thank you.

101
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,300
No, thank you, by the way,

102
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,725
'cause this was the distraction
I needed.

103
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,303
You get Bob talking about himself...

104
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,183
It is just a feedback loop. Non-stop.

105
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,856
- Can we talk about this outside, please?
- Yeah.

106
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,059
Can we talk about this outside?
I'll be right back. I promise.

107
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,977
There's three days left in May.

108
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,985
That gives us 63 hours
to round up the guys and get him.

109
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,066
Great. We can talk about this
over dinner.

110
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,491
What? No, no, no. We have to go now!

111
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,653
Don't you have bathrooms to clean
or something?

112
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,071
Technically, yes, I do.

113
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,239
All right, well, you know what?

114
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,664
- Take this ridiculous thing off...
- Ow.

115
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,624
...and get to it.
We'll talk about this later.

116
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,873
I'll resign, Bob.

117
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,375
You don't have to. You're fired.

118
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,210
Oh, good. 'Cause the benefits here suck!

119
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,465
No, they don't.

120
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,751
That's true. Benefits are really good.

121
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,972
Oh, hey, sorry about that.
Uh, where were we?

122
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,925
- Uh, diabetes. Yes.
- Explain.

123
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,727
Well, uh... I'm not a doctor,
but there are two types.

124
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:01,271
Type one is called "Type One".
And Type Two is more of an adult onset.

125
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,897
No. Him.

126
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,446
- What are you doing?
- Hoagie, what do you want?

127
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,739
You tagged me. I'm it, okay?

128
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,817
You're sitting there
like I didn't just tell you

129
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,322
we gotta deal with this right now.

130
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,572
Because we got a real shot
at Jerry this year.

131
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,781
You say that every year.

132
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,992
- Yeah, but this year's different.
- You say that every year.

133
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,373
- But this year's really different.
- You said that last year.

134
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,749
I know, you're right.

135
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,589
But this year's actually different

136
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,551
because we know exactly
where he's going to be and when.

137
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,845
"The wedding celebration
of Susan and Jerry.

138
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,096
"Saturday, May 31st."

139
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,390
He's a sitting duck!

140
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,064
We gotta join forces. We get Jerry now,

141
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,183
or we die.

142
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,354
- What?
- Eventually. You know what I mean.

143
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,489
Come on, Bob.

144
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,572
You gonna grow old,
or you gonna keep playing?

145
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,075
Keep playing.

146
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,712
That is the right answer.
Nice to meet you.

147
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:04,872
- Uh...
- I'm sorry. I have to go.

148
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:05,956
No. Uh...

149
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,125
Hold on. Hold on.

150
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,926
I can't believe he's getting married,
and he didn't even tell us.

151
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,300
I know. I was mad at first, too,
and then hurt.

152
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,927
But, you know, he just realized
he'd be a sitting target.

153
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,591
That's insane, even for him.

154
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,053
Will one of you please tell me
what's going on here?

155
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,429
Are we off the record?

156
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,146
No, definitely not.

157
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,223
Awesome. Okay.

158
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,901
Our group of friends has been playing
the same game of tag for 30 years.

159
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,272
What?

160
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,698
For the entire month of May,
every year, we play tag.

161
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,774
Just like when we were kids.

162
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,779
But we're not on a playground,
and we all live in different cities.

163
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,157
So you don't ever know
when someone's gonna pop up.

164
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,487
You could be shopping at the mall,

165
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,072
and then your buddy
jumps out of the trunk

166
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,953
and, boom, tags you. You're it.

167
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,117
Here's the craziest part.

168
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,704
Our buddy, Jerry, never been tagged.

169
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,336
What do you mean he's never been tagged?
You never put your hand on his body?

170
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,633
Not during the month of May.
For like, 30 years.

171
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,712
Why don't you just go over to his house
and tag him?

172
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,760
- It's not that easy.
- Why not?

173
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,432
Because...

174
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:02,980
Well, for starters,
because he's so freaking fast.

175
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,648
You just can't catch him.

176
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,568
Yeah,
and if you do manage to catch him,

177
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:12,489
then he goes feral and turns into
some kind of crazy wild animal.

178
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,446
And if you manage
to trap the wild animal,

179
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,783
he still finds a way.

180
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,911
What just happened there?

181
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,288
To this day, I have no idea. No idea.

182
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,422
He's the best that ever played. Yeah.

183
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,007
And now, he wants to retire
with a perfect record,

184
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:39,183
make us all look like fools. Fools!

185
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,138
He gets very excited.

186
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,428
There he is.

187
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,022
Wait. You're not leaving.

188
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,349
Look, Ms. Crosby, I apologize.

189
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,313
Uh, I will have someone from my office
reach out to you.

190
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,145
We will reschedule this
as soon as I'm back in town.

191
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,567
Uh, nope.

192
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,152
- Nope?
- No. Change of plan.

193
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,324
I'm coming with you.

194
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,947
This is a story.

195
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,028
What? No.

196
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,204
Yes. This is the coolest game ever.

197
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,622
I don't think that's gonna be her angle.

198
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,245
I don't know what my angle is,

199
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,078
but I do find it very interesting
that we live in a world

200
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,004
where grown men take an entire month

201
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,546
out of every year
to play a child's game.

202
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,754
It's very interesting.
You're right. Let's go.

203
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,340
I don't think she means interesting
in a good way.

204
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,138
- Get in, Bob.
- Fine! Fuck it, I'm going.

205
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,739
All right, it's all ready for you, Dad.

206
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,914
Hey! Thank you. Thank you.

207
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,253
I'll be honest with you.
Ever since my wife died,

208
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,051
you've really been the rock
holding me down.

209
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,845
So thank you.

210
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,434
Well, I appreciate that.
I really do.

211
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,183
But your wife is not dead.

212
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,140
Well, she's dead to me.

213
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,476
What?

214
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,357
Yeah.

215
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,563
- That's right.
- That's right.

216
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:18,274
Listen to me.

217
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,528
"To live in the past is
to die in the present."

218
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,737
Now, who said that?

219
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,365
- You did.
- Bill Belichick said that!

220
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,041
God love him. Yes, sir.

221
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,584
All right, I'm gonna get us more weed.

222
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:30,661
God bless you, son.

223
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,709
Damn, that was fast!

224
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,670
- Hey!
- Hey, Anna.

225
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,881
- Hey, Chilli. How are you?
- Good, nice to see you.

226
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,091
What are you doing here?

227
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,642
I was... I was walking by

228
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,644
and thought I'd pop in
and say hi to you and Roger.

229
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,223
Yeah, we're doing great. Where's Hoagie?

230
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,603
Oh, um... He's, um...
You know...

231
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,110
- Oh, shit!
- Hogan's in, uh, the library.

232
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,071
Is it... Dad, what month is it?

233
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,114
May.

234
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,072
Mmm-mmm. You're not getting by me.

235
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,410
Anna, are you okay?

236
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,412
He's loose! He's loose!

237
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,496
Fuck it.

238
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,581
Hogan, honey, he's coming.

239
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,210
He's heading down the east stairwell.

240
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,802
- Hey. Hogan!
- Hey, Chilli!

241
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,888
I haven't seen you in a while, man.
How's everything?

242
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,723
- Pretty good. Yeah, what about you?
- Good, yeah.

243
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,353
Everything's good, man. Yeah, work.
I mean, I'm going through that divorce.

244
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,310
- You sure?
- But, everything's fine. It's fine.

245
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,275
Hey, also, side note.
Stop bringing your wife into this, man.

246
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,652
That's bullshit.
She's way too intense for the game.

247
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,529
You're just jealous
'cause she's such a badass.

248
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,027
She's my secret weapon.
Kind of worked 'cause you're trapped.

249
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,537
- Am I trapped?
- Yeah.

250
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,243
I am?

251
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,041
Damn you, Chilli!

252
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,797
Jesus, Chilli!

253
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,174
That's trash!

254
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,400
Fuck me!

255
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,478
Oh, hey, Martin!

256
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,026
Oh. Hi. Sorry.

257
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,080
Excuse me, Mrs. Martin.
Coming through.

258
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,007
Sorry, sorry, sorry,

259
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,001
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

260
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:47,385
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
So sorry. Wow. Okay.

261
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,885
Get him, Andy!

262
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,689
Good, Andy, good!

263
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,193
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

264
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,195
Chilli, Chilli, Chilli...

265
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,154
Chilli! No, no, no!

266
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,170
Oh, fuck!

267
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,054
You okay, buddy?

268
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,304
Oh, just great. Great.

269
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,682
You ain't getting me today, man.
I'm not losing.

270
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,887
There's only one problem, Chilli.

271
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,973
Oh, yeah? What's that?

272
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,808
I'm not it.

273
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,318
The fuck you mean,
you're not it?

274
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,569
I am, motherfucker!

275
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,897
Oh!

276
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,027
- It! Come on. Get up.
- Goddamn!

277
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,285
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

278
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,908
You took a pretty big hit there. My God.

279
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,285
Yeah, I thought I got away.

280
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,163
- Set him up. Knock him down.
- Oh, my God!

281
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,243
- Good idea.
- All right, fair and square.

282
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,328
- I'm it, right?
- Yes.

283
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,457
And now you're it.

284
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,835
- Whoa. Nope.
- Yeah.

285
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,381
Nope. I'm not taking it.

286
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,630
No, I'm not. No!

287
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,089
- No.
- We're not... No!

288
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,298
Guys, we're too old for...

289
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,014
No, don't start hitting. God.

290
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,513
No, no, you're it.
I don't know who is it.

291
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,475
- You're it. You're it.
- Guys, guys!

292
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,727
- This is ridiculous.
- Son of a bitch! You sack punched me!

293
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,478
- Well, you punched me!
- You sack punched him?

294
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,938
Yeah, you went crazy, and now you're it.

295
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,102
- Sorry.
- Okay, I'm it.

296
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,687
Truce, truce, truce.

297
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,772
Deal.

298
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,322
This isn't about us anyway.

299
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,651
This is the year we get Jerry.

300
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,362
- Oh, we're not gonna get Jerry.
- He said the same thing.

301
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,868
No, no. I said the same thing.
We got a plan, all right?

302
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:39,909
Guys! Guys, let's go.

303
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,455
She's so intense, man.
She takes it too far.

304
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,789
You know what? If it wasn't for me,
you guys would be day drunk,

305
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,249
playing mini-golf with 12-year-olds.

306
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,006
Let's go. I know where Sable is.
Get in the car, ladies.

307
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,713
Yeah, we're going right to the airport,
so grab a bag, grab a...

308
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,923
- A toothbrush or whatever.
- I'm good. Let's go.

309
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,262
- Really?
- Wow!

310
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:55,467
- That's gross.
- Well, he's gung-ho. That's good.

311
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,222
Hey, Rebecca,
we're gonna go get Sable now.

312
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:58,807
Who is Sable?

313
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,442
I know you think
she's not cheating on me.

314
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,070
But what about the possibility

315
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,447
of her knowing that I'm following her
to Pilates class,

316
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,571
and on the days
when it's not Pilates class,

317
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,029
that's when she has all the free time
to ride random dick.

318
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,623
Okay, riding dicks.

319
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,918
Kevin, you're really focused
on other dicks.

320
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,545
But what about yours? What about you?

321
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,043
If you don't focus on the other dicks,

322
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,751
those dicks will plug up
the places you wanna go.

323
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:33,339
What about mentally
going into each of those holes

324
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:38,386
and unplugging every one of those dicks.
Pulling out, pulling out, pulling out.

325
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,475
And then you have a clear mind.
Dickless.

326
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,812
Well, I'm paranoid
that my original paranoia

327
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,358
might turn on my paranoia.

328
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,021
It sounds like there are
some fundamental trust issues.

329
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:50,780
You can't trust anybody.

330
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,278
I don't think anyone's out to get you.

331
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,984
I don't think anyone is following you.

332
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,159
Ow! Stop!

333
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,236
I can't take it anymore.

334
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,867
I can't take it. I can't listen to this.

335
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,031
Are you shushing me?

336
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,453
What the fuck?

337
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,339
- Oh, wow!
- How are you?

338
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,383
- Doctor!
- You're there.

339
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,385
Hi, Hogan. Nice to meet you.

340
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,678
Bob Callahan. How do you do?

341
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,220
- Sorry, this is a terrible idea.
- Who are you?

342
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,673
We're friends of Sable's.

343
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,635
We thought it'd be really funny
to hide in there,

344
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:21,640
but then we overheard way too much.

345
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,314
Yeah, buddy, you're clearly
going through a lot of shit.

346
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,807
All right, get here, man.

347
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,394
And, um, also, you're it, so...

348
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,063
I don't care. I miss you.
How are you, buddy? Good to see you.

349
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,613
- I'm good.
- Yup.

350
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,065
- Now you're it.
- I know. I know. I'm it.

351
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,618
Anyway, yeah, we came to get you,
so come on.

352
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,944
- Sable. Come on.
- Come on.

353
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,905
I got 40 minutes left in the session.

354
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,287
- So what? This is important.
- Yeah.

355
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,419
Pack your bags. We're going home.

356
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,623
I don't have my bags here.

357
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:50,999
- Yeah, we know.
- Obviously.

358
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,083
- For fuck's sake.
- I know that. It's just...

359
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,509
We will go by your house
and get your stuff.

360
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,007
You should've just went to my house
in the first place

361
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,087
if we were gonna go to my house anyway.

362
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,139
- This seemed like a better idea.
- It was a whole bit! Let's go.

363
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,557
Yeah, come on, we'll figure it out.

364
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,100
Okay, you'll still owe me for this hour.

365
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,177
Thanks, Doctor.

366
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,262
You guys aren't taking
my mental health seriously.

367
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,663
Look at those little assholes.

368
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,295
- Calm down.
- It's awful to be back.

369
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,592
It's gonna be fun.

370
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,988
Ah! It Still smells the same.

371
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,530
Uh... Here we go.

372
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,995
All right!

373
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:19,254
"Uh!

374
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,634
Okay, yeah.

375
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,143
Oh, yeah, it's still there.

376
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,395
Guys, we're back in the war room.

377
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:33,727
You know what that means.

378
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,232
No, I don't know what that means.

379
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,323
It means we're going to war, Sable.
Now, just to be clear,

380
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,822
we're not gonna tag Jerry
at the actual wedding ceremony

381
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,495
because, frankly,
that would make us giant assholes.

382
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:45,993
I'm sorry. I thought that was
the whole point of this.

383
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,950
I took two weeks unpaid vacation
for that exact reason.

384
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,581
- Two weeks?
- Yeah.

385
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,291
I'm going zip-lining after this.

386
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,583
Okay. There's gonna be plenty of time
to get him before the ceremony.

387
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,962
There's a rehearsal dinner.

388
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,921
There's a luncheon, photo shoot.
Just don't worry. We're gonna get him.

389
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,382
Very official plan. Who wants to smoke
some weed with me? Sable!

390
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,591
I'll take a toke.

391
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,384
What?

392
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:11,064
Yeah, I've been, uh, you know,
experimenting with pot recently.

393
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,024
Mostly medicinal, but hey.

394
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:17,188
I've wanted to get high with you
my entire life, Hogan.

395
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,488
- Honestly.
- Let's do it.

396
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,361
- This is the best gift of all time.
- Okay.

397
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,737
This is exactly how I imagined it,
by the way.

398
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:29,908
Hoagie's morn.

399
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:33,579
I've got pizza rolls
for my pizza roll boys.

400
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,505
Ooh. Pizza rolls.

401
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,551
Is that marijuana I smell?

402
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,431
No. What?

403
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,639
It's my pot. I'm really sorry.
I was smoking pot. It's an old habit.

404
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,475
Oh, so it's your weedie.

405
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,187
I think I'm getting a contact high.

406
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,351
Okay.

407
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,066
Hits me deep. Below the belt, you know.

408
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,947
I've got a belt upstairs.

409
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,028
I use it on naughty little boys.

410
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,157
What the fuck is going on?

411
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,034
I hope you don't hurt those boys.

412
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,540
I don't mean to.

413
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,373
It was really nice speaking with you.
Thank you for the pizza rolls.

414
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:18,541
Mom, stop flirting with Chilli.

415
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,585
Linda, have you seen Jerry lately?

416
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,344
I mean, do you still play tennis
with his mom?

417
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,879
Because we need to find him
before the wedding,

418
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,055
and we've got no clues.

419
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,011
I don't even talk to her.
I never see her at the club.

420
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,644
But I'm thrilled for Jerry.
Susan is such a nice girl.

421
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,813
- We just need the information.
- Yeah, we need to find him. Yeah.

422
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,099
Have you taken the guys
over to the Sandpiper?

423
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:40,441
Lou does nothing but talk about you
and the old days and Jerry.

424
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,855
You know, I think he's lonely.

425
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,445
Okay, that's not helpful. But it...

426
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,609
Oh, my God!

427
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,277
Lou knows everything
going on in this town.

428
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,322
Guys, we're going to the Sandpiper.

429
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,374
I don't wanna go to the Sandpiper.
I'm having a great time here.

430
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,626
I miss this basement.
We don't have any more beer.

431
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,082
Let's go to the Sandpiper.

432
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,633
Lou!

433
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,724
Gentlemen! And ladies.

434
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:17,311
How are you guys?
Hey, we have new summer stouts on draft.

435
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,897
Lou, we don't give a shit about summer
stouts. We're just looking for Jerry.

436
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,604
Ooh, I hate to be the bearer
of bad tidings, Anna,

437
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:24,272
but you are technically
still banned from here.

438
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,569
- What? Still?
- What?

439
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,025
It was dollar margarita night, Lou.

440
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,360
Hey, I don't make the rules.

441
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,653
Fuck you, Lou.

442
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,373
You know something about Jerry.
I can see it in your eyes, you rat fuck.

443
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,788
I don't know where Jerry is.

444
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,168
Fuck you. Tell us.

445
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,207
I'm sorry, Lou. I'm so sorry.

446
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,292
How are you? How's your morn?

447
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,710
- Fantastic.
- Oh, that's good.

448
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,045
- Fit as a fiddle.
- Tell her I said hi.

449
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,129
I will, for sure.
She'll love hearing that.

450
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:49,305
And fuck you.
I don't wanna be in this bar anyway.

451
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,756
- Okay, okay.
- We're gonna wait outside.

452
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:53,643
Look forward to catching up with y'all.
Whoo!

453
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,437
Listen, I'll tell you everything
you need to know about Jerry

454
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:00,896
if you tag me just one time.
It is all I ask. I will spill.

455
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,310
Why can't I tag you?

456
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,984
Because I'm not officially in the game.

457
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,193
What's the good word, Lou?

458
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,530
We don't stop playing
'cause we grow old.

459
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,694
We grow old because we stop playing.

460
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,328
You are not part of this game.

461
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,489
Benjamin Franklin.

462
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,165
- Lou.
- Yeah?

463
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,325
Where's Jerry?

464
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,081
I'm afraid I can't help you out
with that, boys.

465
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,871
- Really?
- Yeah, you see,

466
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,664
Jerry and I struck a little deal.

467
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,834
I say nothing about his whereabouts,
and then I get to play tag next year.

468
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,593
- Jerry made that deal with you?
- Oh, yeah.

469
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,255
And I am unbreakable, boys.

470
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,719
Cannot penetrate this Iron Curtain.

471
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,260
The vault is closed.

472
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:38,434
Well, Lou, that is a real shame because
I was gonna introduce you to Rebecca,

473
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,066
who is writing an article about tag
for The Wall Street Journal.

474
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,358
How cool is that?

475
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,606
- So cool.
- Isn't that exciting?

476
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,904
Is there any way
that Lou could be in your article?

477
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,064
Oh, yeah.

478
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,357
Right? It's an interesting angle, right?

479
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,902
Probably has to be a story
for that to happen, right?

480
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,907
What do you mean,
there has to be a story?

481
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,493
Well, I mean, no Jerry, no story.

482
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,032
You need Jerry for the story?

483
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,917
Could you imagine that thing
printed out here, framed?

484
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,711
- Hanging on the wall? With this guy?
- Yeah.

485
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,003
Which will get published everywhere.
Everyone will see.

486
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,834
- Nationally.
- Don't you wanna be in the article?

487
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,966
Yeah, dude.
I would love to be in an article.

488
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,839
Well, we're not gonna break
Fort Knox here.

489
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,094
Fuck, man. All right.

490
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:11,971
- I was really excited about that story.
- Good to see you, buddy.

491
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,882
- Good luck, man.
- Look, look, look.

492
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,261
My mom talked to his morn,

493
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:21,682
and she said that the rehearsal
is at the Deer Creek Country Club.

494
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,020
- Deer Creek.
- There it is.

495
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,059
Anyways, the name is Louis Seibert.
That's S-E-I-B...

496
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,399
- Oh, I'll remember that. Thank you.
- She's got a great memory.

497
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,068
Big Lou, thank you, buddy.

498
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,777
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you bet.

499
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,577
Oh, hello, Ms. Rollins?

500
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,863
This is Margaret from
the Deer Creek Country Club.

501
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,703
I'm just calling to let you know
we won't be able to refund your deposit

502
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,244
since you canceled the rehearsal
on such short notice.

503
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,583
- This is bullshit.
- Oh, my God!

504
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,464
Uh, we didn't cancel
the reception.

505
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:50,923
I'm afraid we have unfortunately booked
something else in that time slot now.

506
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,303
- A quinceañera.
- A quinceañera.

507
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,385
- This is bullshit.
- Oh, my God!

508
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,049
A celebration of womanhood.

509
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,433
It's a celebration of womanhood.

510
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,140
- This is bullshit.
- Oh, my God!

511
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:01,520
We're coming to the club right now.

512
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:35,550
Hello?

513
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,055
Hello?

514
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,014
Hello, boys.

515
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,850
Who is it?

516
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:49,769
I am.

517
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,401
Callahan approaches
from the left.

518
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,276
Engage no-contact protocol.

519
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,989
No hand shall touch my body.

520
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:10,548
Mental note. Bob slapped Hoagie
with his hand. Hoagie is now it.

521
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,461
Chilli.

522
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,298
He dives at me in a pussy-like fashion.

523
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,225
Poor planning. Poor execution.

524
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,433
Piece of cake.

525
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,640
I head for the door to escape.

526
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,058
Sable blocks it.

527
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,231
It's showtime.

528
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:37,191
Hoagie has tagged Sable.
He is now fair game.

529
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,364
I speedbag him.

530
00:25:56,847 --> 00:25:58,429
Jerry! You okay?

531
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,970
Oh, I've never been better.

532
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,761
Welcome home, boys!

533
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,977
Hey, who's this with you?

534
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,984
Oh, this is Rebecca. She's a reporter.

535
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,152
Very famous.

536
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,525
Did they, uh, mention that
I haven't been tagged in 30 years

537
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,030
'cause they suck at this game?

538
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,152
Extensively.

539
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,654
Never been tagged. Just saying.

540
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:20,863
I can't believe you would rather

541
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,695
not invite your closest friends
to your wedding

542
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:23,988
than risk getting tagged.

543
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:27,375
Hey, Bob, look, you're here, ain't you?
Right? I knew you'd come.

544
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:28,951
Cookie, the valet needs the keys.

545
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,711
Hi, baby. Come here, honey. Come here.

546
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,747
We didn't invite you.

547
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,962
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Uh, guys.

548
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,796
This is Susan, my soon-to-be-bride.

549
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,552
- Hi. Nice to meet you, Susan.
- Hey.

550
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,837
- Hi.
- She'll explain why.

551
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,098
It's just...
I know it sounds really crazy.

552
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,431
It's just, everyone on my mother's side
have had May weddings,

553
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,097
and I don't want
my wedding ruined over...

554
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,525
I swear, I don't wanna be that woman,

555
00:26:52,778 --> 00:26:57,318
but I do feel like that woman is kind
of understandable in this situation.

556
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,489
Don't make excuses, baby.
You don't have to. Come on.

557
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,571
Look, I already broke a fucking window.
What are we gonna do here, guys?

558
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:05,784
- Amendment.
- Amendment.

559
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,039
Amendment. All right. Get in here.

560
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,745
Truce. Truce, bitches.

561
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,170
No tag at the rehearsal.
No tag at the luncheon.

562
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,799
No tag at the dinner. And do not
even mention tag at the ceremony.

563
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,960
Ceremony.

564
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,841
- We got it.
- Thank you.

565
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,129
No way, I'm not signing this.

566
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,763
You're officially re-not invited.
How's that?

567
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:24,924
Okay, then fine.

568
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,638
I'll crash your fucking wedding,

569
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,218
and I'll tag you
as you try to kiss your bride.

570
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,644
Hey, hey, hey.

571
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,180
Look, Susan.
You seem like a lovely person,

572
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,065
and I'm sure this will all be fine.

573
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,728
We just need to formalize it, something
we've been doing a long time and, uh...

574
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,609
Sign it.

575
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:42,275
What the...

576
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,614
"No mention of tag is..."

577
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,529
- Ridiculous.
- It's unreasonable.

578
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:47,868
Thank you, guys.

579
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,619
Here.

580
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,201
All right, boys.

581
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,671
- All right.
- So good to see you, Bob.

582
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,049
You know what? Don't touch me when
we're on a truce. It's very patronizing.

583
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,880
Yeah, it's a little weird for me, too.

584
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,463
Well, it was really nice
meeting everyone,

585
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:07,300
and I look forward to getting to know
you guys better this weekend and just...

586
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,307
I don't know. I've just dreamt
about this day my whole life, so...

587
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,221
- Congrats, Susan. We're happy for you.
- It's gonna be great.

588
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,389
Thank you.

589
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,473
It's really good to see you, boys.

590
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,766
Cheers.

591
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,644
Six tequilas, please.

592
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:23,983
- To Jerry.
- Wait.

593
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,035
Oh!

594
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,739
So, boys, how did it go?

595
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:30,998
- Not good.
- So bad.

596
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,909
So, so bad.

597
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:35,745
Did you guys just sign away
your chance to tag him?

598
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,504
Yeah, but we're still okay
because non-wedding times are fair game.

599
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,963
We just gotta find the right window.

600
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,419
- What happened?
- He kicked our ass.

601
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,717
- Well, technically, he punched my ass.
- Punched your ass.

602
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,922
- Repeatedly.
- Hard.

603
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,599
Well, according to the bylaws,
that is highly illegal.

604
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,976
Except he didn't hit my asshole,

605
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,432
- so it's legal.
- It's legal.

606
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:54,188
Okay, what are you talking about?

607
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,810
Here.

608
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,190
Page“.

609
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,022
Yes! Right there.

610
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:00,941
No asshole punching.

611
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:05,324
Why would you play a game where
you're constantly punched in the ass?

612
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,735
Fair question, Rebecca.

613
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:08,903
Beep. I'll take this.

614
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,248
Tag is more than a game.
It's a way of life.

615
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,498
No, buddy.

616
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,956
That's exactly right. You nailed it.

617
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,245
Facial disgracial.

618
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,754
Okay, Lou, thank you.

619
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,337
We'll take it from here.
Uh...

620
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,546
But he's exactly right.

621
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,006
It's so much more than a game.

622
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,922
Say I'm LeVar Burton.
Say I'm LeVar Burton.

623
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,091
I was there
when Sable lost his virginity.

624
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,176
God damn it, Hoagie!
I was almost finished!

625
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,344
Get over here!

626
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,271
And Callahan was there
when Anna and I had our first child.

627
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,601
Congratulations, buddy.
You're it. Doing great, Anna.

628
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,567
And all the guys were there
for me when my father died.

629
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,449
I think your dad would have
really wanted you to be

630
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,781
it in this moment.

631
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,447
This game,

632
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,500
it's given us a reason to be
in each other's lives all these years.

633
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,833
The last it from each season
will live in shame for one year.

634
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,793
- So what happens if you lose?
- You lose.

635
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,123
- You're it.
- What does the winner get?

636
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,714
There are no winners. Just not losers.

637
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:09,755
I would love to sit here and deconstruct
the spirit of competition with everyone,

638
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,264
but Jerry's still on the loose,

639
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,721
and we've got to get him where it hurts.

640
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,885
- Not in the asshole.
- Not in the asshole. Obviously.

641
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,724
Oh! Guys, let's go to his house.

642
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,263
He wouldn't be at his house.
It's too obvious.

643
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:21,355
Yeah, it's too obvious,
so he's gonna be there. This is Jerry.

644
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,941
Maybe it's so obvious that
it's not obvious that he will be there.

645
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,901
- So he's at the house.
- He's not gonna be there.

646
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:30,409
If he's there, then it'll be obvious
for him to be there,

647
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:31,660
so he wouldn't be there

648
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,697
because he would think that we would
automatically come there, obviously.

649
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,157
What?

650
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,412
You know what? One way to find out.

651
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,576
Let's go.

652
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:39,747
It'll be obvious to...

653
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,161
Come on!

654
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,147
It's locked.

655
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,113
What do you see?

656
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,273
It's nice.

657
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,534
There's lot of attention to detail,
but not too overdone.

658
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,366
Well, can you just unlock it?

659
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:18,832
This is breaking and entering.

660
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,084
No, it doesn't count
if you know the person.

661
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:24,212
That is not true.

662
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:27,959
"Did you guys really think
I would be home?"

663
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,045
Feels like a trap.

664
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,679
All right, let's split up.
We'll cover more ground.

665
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,839
No, that's a terrible idea.

666
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,507
He'll never expect it.

667
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,517
Now help me out of the door, please.

668
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,932
Jerry!

669
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,810
He's gotta be here.

670
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,565
Have you ever even been here before?

671
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,908
Ooh.

672
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,748
Deviled eggs.

673
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,085
Delicious. These go fast.

674
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,086
What the fuck?

675
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,803
Oh, man.

676
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,140
Whoa.

677
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,968
Jerry got chloroform?

678
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,980
What the fuck? He has stepped it up.

679
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,984
Aerial maps of the city.
Bunch of blueprints.

680
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,771
Five different hats? Wow.

681
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,569
People change.

682
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,698
Did you...

683
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,492
I didn't do anything.

684
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,759
Who is that scampering around my house?

685
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,971
Hello, boys, did you really think
I'd go home?

686
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,431
- You idiots.
- I knew it.

687
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:03,687
- It's too obvious.
- Yep.

688
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,347
I mean, that's just a lucky guess.

689
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,515
Okay, Jerry, where are you?

690
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,728
You know, seeing you guys tonight

691
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,940
made me wanna take a walk down
memory lane.

692
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:11,479
Ta-da!

693
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,987
- Is that your...
- That's my bedroom.

694
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,819
You're at my parents' house.
Why are you at my parents' house?

695
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,324
It's a little smaller than I remember.

696
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:17,985
You broke into my house!

697
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,449
We broke into his house.

698
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,239
Yeah, we broke into your house.

699
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,952
Hey, hey! Look who I found, Hoag.

700
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,158
Hoagie, I miss you so much!

701
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,702
What are you doing with Mr. Stubbles?

702
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,041
This little guy got you through

703
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,371
a lot of troubles in life, didn't he?

704
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,914
All right, Jerry.

705
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,585
Let's see where this one goes.

706
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,130
Mr. Stubbles has something to say.
What was that?

707
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:40,140
He says that his skin's very dry.
It needs to be moisturized.

708
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,972
Jerry, put down Mr. Stubbles.
So help me God.

709
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,895
What's happening here?

710
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:48,478
I think he's about to masturbate
in Hoagie's childhood bedroom.

711
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,313
Oh, no.

712
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,398
It's the ultimate act of dominance.

713
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,154
I'm gonna stay here until you come.

714
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:56,903
Unless I come first.

715
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,360
You sly dog.

716
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:03,997
- Go! Go! Go!
- Did you get him?

717
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,908
- Start the car!
- I started it. I started it.

718
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,247
Everybody put their seat belts on.

719
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,751
Go! Go! Go!

720
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,412
- Everybody in.
- Hold on.

721
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,422
Is everybody in?

722
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,754
This is gonna be nice and smooth,
Mr. Stubbies.

723
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,718
This isn't gonna hurt whatsoever.

724
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,429
Stay put. We're coming for you.
We're coming for you.

725
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,812
Yeah, but hurry up! Daddy, hurry up!

726
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,723
Mr. Stubbles is not into you.
He can't be into you.

727
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,062
He's not a sexual being, okay?
So put him down!

728
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,483
Hey, team.

729
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,247
Jerry, how are you in my room right now?

730
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,665
We're all in my room.

731
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,339
No, of course I'm not there. I'm here.
In my basement.

732
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:55,666
Where are you guys?

733
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,006
Are you fucking kidding me?

734
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,137
He built a replica
of your bedroom in his basement?

735
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,639
Good night, gentlemen.

736
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,813
Ah, amateurs.

737
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,273
Let's begin. Um...

738
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,022
So kind of a rough start.

739
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:22,117
That was pretty standard, actually.
Yeah, Jerry's extreme.

740
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,075
The masturbation was fake,
but the pleasure was real.

741
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,865
I mean, I've said it before,
but we're not gonna tag him because,

742
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:30,750
you know, he's better at tag
than us.

743
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,831
I'm obviously going to be the one
that tags Jerry.

744
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:36,249
I've been working
with this Japanese guy. Sensei.

745
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,918
He knows zero karate.

746
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,803
Oh, he doesn't know karate.
He's claiming to know karate?

747
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,383
He doesn't know karate.
I don't think he knows karate.

748
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,598
Well, then what does he call it when
I roundhouse kicked him in 10th grade?

749
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:51,059
Callahan and Chilli did get in a
huge fight sophomore year of high school

750
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:56,102
and Callahan did just tag Chilli
with a beautiful roundhouse kick.

751
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,817
But in Chilli's defense, when Callahan
kicked him...

752
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,231
He shit in his pants!

753
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,150
Yeah, okay, that never happened.

754
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,411
And it's nice to actually get
an opportunity to address it directly.

755
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,742
By all means. I'm all ears.

756
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,250
I mean, I was very sweaty.
It was warm out.

757
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:15,500
The sweaty ass defense?
He's been banging that drum for years.

758
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,585
Hottest October on record, if I recall.
Look it up.

759
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,170
Wall Street Journal,
you have fact checkers

760
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,716
for this exact scenario, right?

761
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,761
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

762
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,804
While you're at it,
can you have the fact checkers look into

763
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,887
if The Maury Povich Show is staged?
'Cause it feels staged,

764
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,018
but he swears it's not staged.

765
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,725
But they do the exact same thing
every time.

766
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,939
What?

767
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,188
Ah!

768
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,826
Sable, I know where
Jerry's gonna be. I need the tag.

769
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:55,999
Okay.

770
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,583
Yeah. Just picked up the tux.

771
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,966
All right, see you soon, babe.

772
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,295
Hey, Rob, how're you doing, bud?
Good to see you.

773
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,679
You, too, man.

774
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,807
Gloria, ma'am.

775
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,183
- My balloon!
- Whoa!

776
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:12,970
Hey, this must be yours, buddy.

777
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,138
Thanks, mister.

778
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,396
Oh, look at that.
You gonna eat that whole thing?

779
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,358
You know what? You should consider
some alternative snacks.

780
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,694
Keeping fitness fun, buddy.

781
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,245
Oh. Excuse me, ma'am.

782
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,281
You dropped your...

783
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,409
Men's athletic crossover-style boot,

784
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,123
size nine and a half.

785
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,462
Suggests a man
that is neither fashionable

786
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,419
nor athletic.

787
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,583
Hoagie.

788
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,140
Little does Hoagie know

789
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,022
I've been teaching a women's
self-defense boot camp for six years.

790
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,148
First defense 101.

791
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,605
Class is in session.

792
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,945
Holy shit!

793
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:39,973
Hmm.

794
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,491
- You're done, Hoagie.
- Never!

795
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:54,655
You're done.

796
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:55,823
Never!

797
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,084
All right, I'm done.

798
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,913
Dude, you look amazing, by the way.
You've really upped your game!

799
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:04,752
How'd you know I was gonna be here?

800
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,425
Aha! Surprised you, right?

801
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,839
I saw the pick-up ticket for your tailor

802
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,011
when we broke into your house
the other night.

803
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,007
Impressive.

804
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,471
I'm taking you down, Jerry.

805
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,511
Well, we both know
that's never gonna happen.

806
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,646
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Coming through. Excuse me.

807
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:21,932
Oh, boy. Cavalry's coming in.

808
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,521
Hey, Jerry.

809
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,106
This old lady bothering you?

810
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,692
I'm good, Marvin. Thanks, man.
Everything's all right.

811
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,072
It's just a friend of mine.

812
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:30,448
Hey, it's good to see you.
Looking good, brother.

813
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,614
- My man.
- Yeah, staying in shape.

814
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,950
What the fuck?

815
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,240
All right, well, maybe
I'll call the police. All right?

816
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,375
This is assault.
You willing to go to jail for this?

817
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,623
Oh, you're goddamn right, I am.

818
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:48,384
Okay, then maybe I will cause
a big scene and get arrested also.

819
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,045
Then, once we both get to jail,
I'll just...

820
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,337
What? Bribe a guard?

821
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,924
Be put in my cell? Yeah, I figured
you'd say that. It's pretty obvious.

822
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,138
Hoag, you have to realize
that's gonna take hours,

823
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,552
during which time

824
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,437
I'll have fashioned
a shiv from my toothbrush

825
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:01,934
and used it to murder my cellmate.

826
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,223
You'd just shiv your cellmate?

827
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,859
Don't worry. He's a bad person
who's done terrible things,

828
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:07,019
so justice is served.

829
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,270
Okay.

830
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,321
It gets me thrown in solitary
confinement, which is what I want.

831
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,658
Out of reach. Completely untaggable.

832
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,284
Damn, you have thought this through.

833
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,121
Pretty good, right?

834
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,160
Look, understand two things, Hoagie.

835
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,038
First, you're not gonna screw up
this wedding. Okay?

836
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,204
And secondly,
I will never let you tag me.

837
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,589
You're gonna die before that ever
happens. You understand that, right?

838
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,298
I don't fear death, Jerry.
And I'm not gonna give this up

839
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:33,587
till I die.

840
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,298
Okay. Good luck.

841
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,893
See you at the rehearsal, Jerry.

842
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:56,535
Mmm! These hushpuppies are insane.

843
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,611
All right, listen.

844
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:01,949
T-minus 34 minutes until this rehearsal
dinner is over, and Jerry's fair game.

845
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,751
There's four of us. There's four exits.
Let's fan out and trap this rat.

846
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,161
Okay? Synchronize your watches.

847
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,125
- I don't know how to do that.
- I don't wear a watch.

848
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,165
Time is a construct.

849
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,926
Okay, uh, 5:00.

850
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,712
Could have said that at the beginning.

851
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,254
Well, we said it now.

852
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,924
- 5:00, how hard is that?
- 5:00, yeah, it's easy.

853
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,059
- Hi, guys. How are you?
- How are you?

854
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,594
Sorry about the other night.
That wasn't...

855
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:23,887
- Oh!
- Yeah, that wasn't cool.

856
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,181
No. I mean, listen,
I know it's not just you guys.

857
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:28,396
I mean, Jerry's worse than all of you.

858
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,151
He's very competitive.

859
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,527
When we were kids, we had a contest

860
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,190
to see who could hold their breath
for the longest underwater.

861
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,362
He almost died.

862
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,194
He won, but at what cost? Really?

863
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:43,373
Oh, I hope he's this competitive
when it comes to being a father.

864
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,450
Are you pregnant?

865
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,161
- Really?
- Yeah, that's why the Shirley Temple.

866
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,625
- Oh, my gosh!
- I know.

867
00:41:49,799 --> 00:41:51,085
- Here, cheers!
- Congratulations, that's great!

868
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:52,374
- Cheers, thank you!
- Oh, my gosh!

869
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:53,838
- That's such good news.
- Thank you. Yeah.

870
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,878
- We're not telling that many people.
- Okay.

871
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,012
Listen, I know
it's gonna get a little wacky

872
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,672
over the next couple of days
with you guys.

873
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,512
- Sure the fuck is, yeah.
- Okay.

874
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,094
Just don't go too far

875
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,476
and go out there and play golf.
It's amazing. Do something fun.

876
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:10,059
- Okay? Okay. Bye, guys.
- See you.

877
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,520
I like her.
She has a beautiful personality.

878
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,563
Very effervescent. Good energy.
Good vibes.

879
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,155
Ah, don't believe a word
she fucking says.

880
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,611
She's a hired hand. She's an actress.

881
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,613
- What?
- I mean, look at this son of a bitch.

882
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,653
- This is Colonel Sanders in the flesh.
- That's, like, her uncle.

883
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,868
- It's the fucking Truman Show.
- Will you stop?

884
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,290
The whole thing. Jerry set it up.
I guarantee it.

885
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,118
Every single person here has been hired.

886
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,577
You have gotta calm down.

887
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,664
Hi. Nice to meet you. I'm his wife.

888
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,092
Jerry, is that Cheryl Deakins?

889
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,220
Oh, yeah. Good. Hey!

890
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,931
- You invited her?
- Yeah, of course.

891
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,094
What?

892
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,979
What? We're all old friends.

893
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,639
Makes sense.

894
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,023
I'm not buying this.

895
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,228
Is that, uh...

896
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,022
Cheryl Deakins.

897
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,235
You know she was coming, Bob?

898
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,408
- I did not.
- I didn't either.

899
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,568
She looks good.

900
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,328
- Great. She always does.
- Yeah.

901
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,322
Wow!

902
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,616
Uh, who is Cheryl Deakins?

903
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:10,627
Is she like the Yoko or something?

904
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:12,333
I don't get that reference,

905
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,340
but she's someone whose presence
causes strain on our group.

906
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,592
We've known her since grade school.

907
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,597
She was the first girl that Chilli
and Callahan had a crush on.

908
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:25,888
When we were kids,
Cheryl was into Chilli,

909
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,679
much to Callahan's chagrin.

910
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,063
But young love is unpredictable.

911
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:34,192
Later that same year, she decided
she was into Callahan,

912
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:36,774
much to Chilli's chagrin.

913
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,699
But she always had
a place in her heart for Chilli.

914
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:50,788
And this went on for decades.

915
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,124
And all of a sudden,
she just married an orthodontist.

916
00:43:53,214 --> 00:43:54,204
Huh.

917
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,581
They get all the chicks.

918
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:57,666
What?

919
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,216
How long has it been
since you've seen her?

920
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,128
About 10 years for me. How about you?

921
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:02,970
Same, I guess.

922
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,889
- Been a while.
- Sure has.

923
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,809
You sneaky trickster.

924
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,767
She looks amazing, and you know it.
Think about this.

925
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,308
What if Cheryl ended up getting back
together with our boy?

926
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,771
- Chilli?
- Callahan?

927
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,060
Obviously.

928
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,361
- Wait. What?
- Duh.

929
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,942
- Did you say Chilli?
- You're Team Callahan?

930
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,982
- Yeah!
- We've been married all this time,

931
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,491
and you think she should end up
with Callahan?

932
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,993
Of course. Wait, you think Chilli?

933
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,622
Wait, do you know those guys at all?

934
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,202
Who are you right now?

935
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:31,283
- What?
- You're freaking me out.

936
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,367
I feel like I don't even know you.

937
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,914
You're like this foreign person.

938
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,210
Do you want me to be a foreign person?

939
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,749
What?

940
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,960
Here? Right now?

941
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,465
Because, um...

942
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:45,593
I just got lost
on the way to bibliothéque,

943
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,973
and I don't know
where all my other French friends are.

944
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:49,179
Chantelle is here?

945
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,559
Chantelle is here with...

946
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,720
Oh, my God!

947
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,808
Honey, it's almost 5:00.

948
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,189
Keep your head in the game.

949
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,353
You're so good.

950
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,942
Come on, we'll go to the bathroom
for five minutes.

951
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,106
All right.

952
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,524
- It's crazy.
- Huh.

953
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,693
- Hey, you should go talk with her.
- No, you should go.

954
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:07,952
Neither of you should.

955
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,371
- Thanks.
- You're welcome. Neither one.

956
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:11,911
Shut up, Sable.

957
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,366
No, honestly, it should be you, Bob.

958
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,080
No, I think she really
wants to talk to you

959
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:18,084
'cause I think girls really like,
you know,

960
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:21,420
depressed guys that still have a name
for their bong.

961
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,717
Get a good one.

962
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,721
This is gonna go great.

963
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:32,685
Thank you.

964
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,562
All right, good advice.

965
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,182
Good luck.

966
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,185
Tell her I said hi.

967
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,523
Cheryl Deakins.

968
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,700
Chilli Cilliano.

969
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,198
How'd you know it was me?

970
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:52,205
I'd know that faint smell of sativa
and Old Spice anywhere.

971
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,116
Yeah. I had to get a little stoned.

972
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,204
I can't be sober at these things.
They're awful.

973
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,916
That was the wrong choice, man.

974
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,288
What?

975
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:04,460
Neither of you should have gone,
but if one of you should have went,

976
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:05,968
then it should have been you.

977
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:07,633
How many wines have you had?

978
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,842
How many legs does an octopus have?

979
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,805
Well, eight.

980
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,975
I see that you've been
rejecting fashion trends

981
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,940
and haircuts and maybe hygiene.
I respect that.

982
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:27,574
Well, I think respect is the key to the
beginning of rebuilding a friendship.

983
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:29,943
- Is that a saying? Maybe?
- Yeah, sure. Who said that?

984
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:33,284
I don't know. I wanna hear
about this husband of yours.

985
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:38,160
What's the story?
Is he still charming, sensible, rich?

986
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,499
No. Dead.

987
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,751
Yeah, same with me.

988
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,711
Dead to me. Divorced.

989
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:49,470
No, I mean he's "dead" dead.
He actually died.

990
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,013
He's dead?

991
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,095
For real?

992
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,600
Oh...

993
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,849
Yeah, he, um...

994
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,476
He died in a car crash.
We were separated already.

995
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:00,932
Oh, you already separated.

996
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:02,893
- Yeah.
- And now he's dead. He's gone.

997
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,151
- He's gone.
- Officially.

998
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,905
Act a little more upset about it.

999
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,566
I know, but, anyway, how are you?
How's your life?

1000
00:47:09,702 --> 00:47:13,912
Great. I lost my business. Divorced.
Playing tag competitively.

1001
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,116
Pretty much rock bottom.

1002
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,578
- Are you trying to make me horny?
- Fuck yes, lam.

1003
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,033
- 'Cause it's happening.
- It is?

1004
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,210
Oh, yeah.

1005
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:23,955
So have you tried the hushpuppies,
or what?

1006
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,415
What do you think they're talking about?

1007
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:29,419
I don't know, and I don't want
you to worry about it.

1008
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:30,712
We've got 15 minutes.

1009
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:35,305
Oh, Chilli, I think about you
all the time, Chilli.

1010
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,932
Oh, yeah? But what about
Callahan? He's so handsome.

1011
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,347
He's very handsome,
but he's a selfish lover

1012
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,811
with a small dick.

1013
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,059
Really?

1014
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,484
Plus he sobs after he comes.

1015
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,019
Okay.

1016
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,229
Wow.

1017
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,899
It's okay, Callahan.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

1018
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,609
Okay, you know what?
You guys are all 12-year-olds.

1019
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:53,693
Oh, Chilli.

1020
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:56,450
Hey, Cheryl, I want to reconnect.

1021
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:00,079
Oh, yeah.

1022
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:01,659
- What's happening now?
- Oh, Bob!

1023
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,920
Yeah, I'm just...
Oh, I'm just feeling the vibes.

1024
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:08,462
I mean, who wants to have sex
with a guy named Bob?

1025
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,594
"Oh, Bob." Just doesn't sound right.
"Oh, Bob."

1026
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:12,970
won, Bob."
won, Bob."

1027
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,222
- "Bob. Bob, Bob."
- "Oh, Robert."

1028
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,390
"Bob."

1029
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,925
I wasn't gonna text you, you know?

1030
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:19,390
I didn't wanna mess with you
when you were married.

1031
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,145
No, I think that's nice. Respectful.

1032
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,601
If I knew he was dead,
I would have texted right away.

1033
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:23,765
All right. Okay.

1034
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:26,355
- No! Please don't leave on that!
- No, it's fine.

1035
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:28,361
We're good. We're good.
I'm just gonna use the ladies' room.

1036
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,479
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

1037
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,563
- It's nice to see you.
- It's great to see you.

1038
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:31,773
You too.

1039
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,028
Widowed.

1040
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,093
Cheryl Deakins.

1041
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,007
What are you doing here?

1042
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,175
And where are the urinals?

1043
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:00,968
Probably in the men's room.

1044
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,222
- You haven't changed a bit.
- Thank you.

1045
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,731
No, that was not a compliment.

1046
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,767
Well, I have matured.

1047
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,276
Have you? Really?

1048
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,859
Because this old move where you
follow me into the bathroom,

1049
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:13,443
it's exactly what you did
at junior prom.

1050
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,949
It was a good move then,
and it's a good move now.

1051
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,701
- Marginally nicer bathroom.
- Mmm.

1052
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,487
Do you wanna get a drink?

1053
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,118
Uh, actually, I think
I'm gonna head home.

1054
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,373
Can I give you a ride?

1055
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:24,367
- Sure.
- Great.

1056
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,876
Right after we have that drink.

1057
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,502
Oh, I see what you did there.

1058
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:35,132
Okay, guys. It's almost go time.
ls everybody in position? Over.

1059
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,425
Sable is in position.

1060
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,975
- Chilli!
- Yeah. Let's get him.

1061
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:44,228
Callahan. Callahan,
do you read me? Over.

1062
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,516
Callahan. Where are you, buddy?

1063
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,900
Callahan!

1064
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,280
We got an unguarded exit, okay?

1065
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:56,941
Hi.

1066
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,239
Callahan!

1067
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:07,373
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1068
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:08,453
Go!

1069
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:10,167
Not today, motherfucker!

1070
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,087
Hey, thanks for coming. Appreciate it.

1071
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,472
Go! Go!

1072
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:22,884
Come and get it, bitches!

1073
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,471
- Get in! Get in!
- We're close. We're close.

1074
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,014
Go!

1075
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:43,696
- Hold on! Hold on!
- Go, go!

1076
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,249
Go faster! Go faster!

1077
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:48,701
Giddy up!

1078
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,083
We're coming for you!

1079
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,832
Go, Hoagie, go!

1080
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:01,506
Jesus!

1081
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,975
Incoming!

1082
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:07,679
- Son of a bitch!
- Come on!

1083
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,229
CHILLll Go! Go!

1084
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:12,016
God, I wish I had my gun here.

1085
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,310
There are so many good birds to shoot.

1086
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,279
So this is a vacation for you?

1087
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:21,408
Yeah. I mean, some couples go
on cruises. Some couples go camping.

1088
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:25,368
Some couples go to strip clubs
and have gangbangs,

1089
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,282
and this is just what we do.
This is what we love.

1090
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,870
This is our gangbang.

1091
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,044
You know, it seems to me like
you'd be really good at the game.

1092
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,204
- Why don't you play?
- Well,

1093
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:36,340
they came up with the rules
when they were nine. No girls allowed.

1094
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,677
And to be honest, I can get a little

1095
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,596
overly aggressive
and competitive sometimes.

1096
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,427
Come on, Jerry.
You're dead meat!

1097
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,259
Yeah, kick his ass!

1098
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,144
Keep your eyes downfield!

1099
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:49,770
Cut across the fourth fairway!

1100
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,772
Don't fuck this up!

1101
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:53,608
Yeah. Well.

1102
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,524
Oh, I have to show you
pictures of our kids.

1103
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:00,903
Go, go, go!

1104
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:03,905
Get him, Hoagie. Get him!

1105
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,240
Hold on. Hold on.

1106
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,205
Hoagie, stop!

1107
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,542
- Hoagie, what are you doing?
- I can't see!

1108
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:23,179
Ahh! Whoo!

1109
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:25,923
Everybody good?

1110
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:28,555
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1111
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,762
Well, that happened.

1112
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,393
Onward.

1113
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:35,892
Let's get him.

1114
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,226
Whoo! That was invigorating.

1115
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:50,039
On.

1116
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:53,292
That is psychological warfare
right there.

1117
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:55,036
That's impressive.

1118
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:56,249
Yeah, that's a good move.

1119
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:57,788
Good one, Jer!

1120
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,543
There he is!

1121
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,421
Hello, boys.

1122
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,929
What?

1123
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:11,511
What the...

1124
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,891
How's he doing this?

1125
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,146
All right, Jerry, stop!

1126
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,556
He's multiplying!
It's happening!

1127
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:16,724
- What the fuck?
- There's one!

1128
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:19,811
One is there!

1129
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,103
- Hey!
- What?

1130
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,901
You guys, there's so many.
There's so many!

1131
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:24,065
What the...

1132
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:26,484
There he is! I'm coming for you, Jerry!

1133
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:27,693
Chilli, you're not even it!

1134
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,377
I'm on your ass!

1135
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:40,456
Come on!

1136
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,679
Oh, shit!

1137
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,386
Shit!

1138
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:04,029
This is terrible. This is pure bullshit.

1139
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,189
We should not be here.

1140
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,783
This is getting way too extreme.

1141
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,611
I need you to buck up, Sable.

1142
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,028
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's stay focused.

1143
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:13,785
Yeah, we bucked up
out of the goddamn golf cart.

1144
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,288
You smell that?
Do you smell it?

1145
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:21,752
It's Jerry. I smell him.

1146
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,006
It's leaves and grass.

1147
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,084
And centipedes.

1148
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:26,961
Just typical woods stuff.

1149
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,430
He's close.

1150
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,761
I can feel it.

1151
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,140
I can feel something.

1152
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:34,847
Oh, shit!

1153
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,265
- Jesus! Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.

1154
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:41,434
- Oh my, God!
- Wow, that's crazy.

1155
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,271
Our friend is a psychopath,
and this is scary.

1156
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,282
He got me. I'm down.

1157
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:51,076
This is on you now. Come here.

1158
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:52,907
Let me tag you.

1159
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,289
Come on!

1160
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:56,949
All right.

1161
00:54:58,337 --> 00:54:59,327
I can see him.

1162
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:02,839
He's at three o'clock. 50 yards out.

1163
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,749
- Three o'clock. Got it.
- Three o'clock.

1164
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,713
Sable!

1165
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,089
That three o'clock.

1166
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,224
- You didn't say which time zone, man!
- There's no time zones.

1167
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,601
Why didn't you just point
the first time? Next time, just point.

1168
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:17,933
It's that way. Go!

1169
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,096
- Okay.
- Go, go, go.

1170
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:20,598
Go, Sable, go!

1171
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:46,499
I see you.

1172
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,048
Yeah, motherfucker.

1173
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:56,259
You're it!

1174
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:09,863
Oh, I don't like that.

1175
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,281
Sleep.

1176
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:24,871
Sable?

1177
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:27,206
Sable?

1178
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,021
What happened?

1179
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,314
Well, you got chloroformed.

1180
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,017
Chloroformed? What?

1181
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,897
Bob took our car,
and now we're in a Lyft.

1182
00:56:47,988 --> 00:56:49,103
We're going to the Sandpiper.

1183
00:56:49,698 --> 00:56:50,688
I don't wanna be it anymore.

1184
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:52,982
I don't wanna be it.
Hoagie, it's on you, bud.

1185
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,066
Now, what the fuck?

1186
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:56,402
Wait. I'm confused.
What just happened in there?

1187
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,117
Well, Jerry woke up early,
got some grounds crew

1188
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:02,249
to go out in the woods, build some
snares and a swinging log trap,

1189
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,956
and, uh, wear matching outfits
to act as decoys.

1190
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,329
Maniac.

1191
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,127
Are you okay?

1192
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:13,301
Yes, yes. lam. lam... I'm good.

1193
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:16,467
I am amazed that you're able to stay
so optimistic after all that.

1194
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:19,134
Well, some have said
I am the heart and soul of the game.

1195
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:20,517
No, you've said that.

1196
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,052
You're the only person
I've heard say that.

1197
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,973
Well, technically "just me"
fits the legal definition of "some,"

1198
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,767
so suck a dick.

1199
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,404
Well, it seems like the game
has really kept you guys connected.

1200
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,156
- Exactly.
- Well, except Jerry.

1201
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:35,691
What? Don't say that.

1202
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,359
How often do you see Jerry
outside of tag?

1203
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,367
Hmm... Well, not super frequently, but...

1204
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,077
I mean, would you consider that
a close friendship?

1205
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,833
Well, that's kind of a dicky question.

1206
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,300
Thank you.

1207
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:03,761
All I'm saying is,
Callahan better fucking be here.

1208
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,102
What's up? What?

1209
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,485
Look who decided to show up.

1210
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:13,987
What? I had a business call
with Beijing.

1211
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,064
Couldn't be helped. I'm sorry.

1212
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,783
Business call with Beijing? It would
have been 8:00 a.m. Saturday out there.

1213
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:19,944
You doing business calls
at 8:00 a.m. Saturday morning?

1214
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:21,738
Why do you know so much
about Beijing time zones?

1215
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,748
2008 Olympics. Michael Phelps, baby.

1216
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,538
Fair enough.
Okay, anyway, I have an idea.

1217
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:28,874
- Anybody want to hear it?
- Yes.

1218
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,913
- What is it?
- Jerry's gym.

1219
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:32,919
Someone there's gotta know where he is.

1220
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:35,209
- I like this. That's a good idea.
- Great!

1221
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,219
- Up top! Buckle up, gang!
- Yes! Giddy up!

1222
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:38,754
- You're it, by the way.
- What's wrong?

1223
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,593
- My fucking knee.
- What's wrong with your knee?

1224
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,757
I got hit by a log.

1225
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:42,933
You got hit by a log, what?

1226
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,057
We were chasing him. I got hit
by a fucking log. It really hurts.

1227
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:47,514
I'm gonna go in. Fuck, I'm pissed off
about this, but go.

1228
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,938
You want me to call the pediatrician?

1229
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,432
I'm an adult.
I don't need a pediatrician.

1230
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,517
You're not coming?

1231
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,648
I think I'm gonna slow you down.
Why don't you guys go?

1232
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:54,983
After the gym, let's meet up.

1233
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:56,147
All right, fine.

1234
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,314
Trust me, I wanna go, but I just...

1235
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,109
Y'all need a sub? Huh? I'm in!

1236
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,823
We're super good, man. Thanks!

1237
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,654
We're good.

1238
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:06,073
Who's banned now, bitch?

1239
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:10,127
I'm okay.
All right, guys. Take it easy!

1240
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,294
Phew.

1241
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,469
Oh, that knee healed up fast.

1242
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,259
Stay out of this, Lou.

1243
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,481
Oh, you saucy devil.

1244
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:45,864
Hey, there, welcome to Granite Fitness.
Get hard, stay hard.

1245
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,999
Just so you guys know, we're going
to be closing in five short minutes,

1246
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,160
but is there anything
I can help you with?

1247
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,495
Yes, Dave, in fact, there is something
you could help us with.

1248
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,914
How would you like to earn $500?

1249
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:06,179
Okay, just so you guys know, I'm not
sucking your guys' dicks, all right?

1250
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:07,969
And I'm not letting you
suck my dick either.

1251
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:11,104
No one is talking about anyone
sucking anyone's anything.

1252
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,266
You sure about that?
'Cause this guy's eyeing me hard.

1253
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:15,643
What?

1254
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,061
I'm just saying, man,
you've got that vibe.

1255
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,737
- Yeah?
- Stop it.

1256
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:20,238
Hey, Sable, seriously. Chill.

1257
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,569
- Just stop it.
- Stop it.

1258
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:25,449
It's too sexual. You're undressing me,
literally, right now with your eyes.

1259
01:00:25,539 --> 01:00:31,501
Dave. 500 bucks, and all we want
is to know where Jerry is.

1260
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,039
Oh!

1261
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:36,418
Jerry. Yes, okay, shit.

1262
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:39,796
He did mention that some people
were gonna swing by looking for him.

1263
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,761
He left a message. Um, oh, yeah.

1264
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:44,387
Go fuck yourselves.

1265
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,841
Okay, look. $1,000.
All right? Easy money.

1266
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,133
Jerry won't even know
that you sold him out.

1267
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,177
I got a better idea.
Why don't you go back

1268
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,687
to the little Best Western
that you're staying in

1269
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:54,940
and jerk each other off in the nude?

1270
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:57,272
Why do you keep taking this conversation
into a sexual direction?

1271
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,528
Listen, Dave. $1,500. Don't be an idiot.

1272
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:02,861
Not a chance,
you dick-sucking homophobes.

1273
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:04,237
- Hey!
- What?

1274
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,484
Dave?

1275
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:07,782
Do you know what we're gonna do?

1276
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:08,946
What?

1277
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:14,953
We're gonna waterboard you.

1278
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,589
Don't be a hero, Dave.

1279
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,383
Jerry doesn't give a shit about you.

1280
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,102
So tell us where he is.

1281
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:33,895
I'm never gonna tell you.

1282
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:35,976
Last chance, Dave.

1283
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:41,187
You're not gonna go through with this
for some game, so quit jerking me off!

1284
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:44,064
Oh, Jesus.

1285
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,778
No one's jerking you off, kid,

1286
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,659
'cause Jerry has pushed us
to the fucking edge.

1287
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,911
If you don't tell us
what we need to know,

1288
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:51,614
you're going over the edge with us.

1289
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:52,906
You ready to die for this shit?

1290
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:55,200
I'd rather die than get sucked off
by you homophobes.

1291
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,245
We're not gonna suck you off.
We're gonna waterboard you.

1292
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,289
I'm just taking
a principled stand right now.

1293
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,708
Okay. Well, guess what.
Now, this is gonna happen. All right?

1294
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,627
Are you ready?
I hope you can hold your breath, son!

1295
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:05,711
Do it!

1296
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,512
'Cause this is going right down!

1297
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,593
- Yeah!
- Yeah! You son of a bitch!

1298
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:10,849
Here it comes!

1299
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,180
It's coming!
It's coming! It's coming!

1300
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:14,140
Yeah. You know, we should not.

1301
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,476
I feel like it would be way too much.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1302
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:17,685
Phew. That got out of hand.

1303
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,520
My heart is beating
really fast right now.

1304
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,776
We were just kidding.
We were just bluffing.

1305
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:24,530
- No, we weren't fucking bluffing!
- Anna, Anna, Anna!

1306
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,815
- Oh, my God, no. Just, no.
- Sweetheart.

1307
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,826
It's a war crime, right?
It's not really who we are.

1308
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:30,986
Yes, sorry.

1309
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,030
We got a kinky cat over here.

1310
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,786
- Okay.
- Fuck you, Dave.

1311
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,792
God, I love your passion.

1312
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:38,578
I'll tell you what.

1313
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:43,465
I will tell you where Jerry's gonna be

1314
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:47,966
for $2,000. Cash. American.

1315
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,129
- Okay, fine.
- No problem.

1316
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,638
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

1317
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:52,345
Why did you take us
down this whole road?

1318
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:54,180
Well, it looked like
there was room to negotiate,

1319
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:55,386
and I was all prepared to do that.

1320
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,725
But then we went down
the whole torture track,

1321
01:02:57,899 --> 01:03:00,982
and I just dug
my heels in, philosophically.

1322
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:02,685
I happen to be an objector.

1323
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:05,191
- We are too, obviously.
- Not really.

1324
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:06,355
It was a bluff.

1325
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,023
You know what?
You should probably not write this down,

1326
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,316
and if it does come up,

1327
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:12,577
just mention that
we didn't actually waterboard him.

1328
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:13,737
No waterboarding.

1329
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,122
Just a lot of talk about
sucking each other's dicks.

1330
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:17,658
Yeah.

1331
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,001
Okay, look, you know what? Here.

1332
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:26,213
I'm gonna give you $2,000,
and I'm gonna give you an extra $500.

1333
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,423
You just carry around that kind of cash
all day?

1334
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,587
You were mentioning something
about Jerry, I think.

1335
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:34,099
Yeah, uh, Jerry is in AA.

1336
01:03:34,269 --> 01:03:36,806
- Wait, what?
- Yeah. Alcoholics Anonymous.

1337
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,971
I know what it stands for. Wait, did you
guys know anything about this?

1338
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:42,065
He goes there every morning
at a church on Brunswick.

1339
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,942
Looking back, I can kind of see it.

1340
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,570
I mean, the first step is recognizing
you have a problem.

1341
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:49,694
I'm just glad
he's getting the help he needs.

1342
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:51,988
Sorry, did you say
that church is on Brunswick?

1343
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:53,152
- Yes.
- Okay!

1344
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:54,619
- Let's go! Clean up the water!
- Thank you!

1345
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,120
So sorry.

1346
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:59,871
I told you this wasn't gonna be just
another boring corporate profile, right?

1347
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:01,535
Right. This is definitely different.

1348
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:04,205
And I know I'm no longer
the center of the story,

1349
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,498
which is fine with me.
I don't mind giving up the...

1350
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,465
Bob, can I buy you a drink?

1351
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:13,346
Can you fucking believe this?
Hold on one second.

1352
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,299
- Maybe...
- One second, one second.

1353
01:04:15,477 --> 01:04:17,309
Terrible experience.
So that we will never do it...

1354
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:20,972
Hi! Hi! Wow! Look at this.

1355
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:22,184
- How you doing?
- Good.

1356
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:23,520
Pretty good.
Yeah, we're just catching up.

1357
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,058
That's so nice. How's that knee?

1358
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,977
- It actually does hurt.
- Yeah.

1359
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,772
But resting and talking to an old friend
has actually really helped.

1360
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,110
Thank you for asking.

1361
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,691
Hey, how was the business call
with Beijing?

1362
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,234
- Super good.
- It was?

1363
01:04:34,329 --> 01:04:36,240
- Yeah, I got a lot done.
- Great.

1364
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,368
Oh, what, you think I faked
my business call to Beijing

1365
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:39,664
like you faked hurting your knee?

1366
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:42,166
You know what, dude?
I'm sick of this shit, Bob.

1367
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:43,919
- You're it. How about that?
- No! Pass.

1368
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:45,875
- You can't pass. And you can't tag back.
- You're it. I pass.

1369
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,505
- Oh, my God.
- It's like literally the first rule.

1370
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:49,086
- You're it! You're it! You're it!
- You cannot tag me back!

1371
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,839
- I'll rewrite the fucking rule book!
- Shut up!

1372
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:52,920
Why're you acting like children?

1373
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:54,421
- 'Cause he started it.
- You started it.

1374
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:55,597
You literally started it.

1375
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:56,718
- No, you started it!
- "Oh, my knee hurts."

1376
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:57,845
What do you think they're talking about?

1377
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,051
Are we off the record?

1378
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:00,560
Yeah, sure, sure.

1379
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:02,683
No idea.

1380
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,393
You know what?
I shouldn't have come.

1381
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,100
Jerry always gets in your head.

1382
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,938
Did Jerry tell you to say that?

1383
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:09,649
You part of the whole
Truman Show of it all?

1384
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,814
I mean, Jerry invited me
to the rehearsal dinner

1385
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:14,574
because he thought it would distract
you guys, which it did.

1386
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:18,282
But, um, I wanted to see you. So I came.

1387
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:19,408
Sure.

1388
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:20,489
On, my God.

1389
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:23,951
You guys are fucking idiots.
Both of you. But I love you both.

1390
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:26,207
I'm gonna go. Maybe I'll see you later.
Or not.

1391
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,544
- Cheryl...
- Go get Jerry. He fucking deserves it.

1392
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:32,209
Bye, Cheryl.

1393
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:34,257
Wow!

1394
01:05:34,431 --> 01:05:35,421
What do you want?

1395
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:38,720
There's gonna be plenty of time
to get rejected by Cheryl

1396
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,555
after 12:00 a.m. on June 1st.

1397
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:46,974
So what I need you guys to focus on,
is the fact that we're a team.

1398
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:50,486
Right? We love each other,
and we love this.

1399
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:54,569
Let's bask in that.
Stay focused on our mission. All right?

1400
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,358
Let's get back on this horse and ride.

1401
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:57,992
Let's get this asshole.

1402
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,325
Lou, not part of it. Not at all.

1403
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,704
Now, shake.

1404
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:03,782
Shake!

1405
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:09,205
All right. Now we got some work to do.

1406
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:22,634
Got it.

1407
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,644
Go get him, sweetie.

1408
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,111
Okay.

1409
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:45,703
Hey, do you think we should talk
to Jerry about being an alcoholic

1410
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:48,335
- before we get into all this?
- No.

1411
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:55,300
But now, I've been clean and sober
for almost four years.

1412
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:59,471
Thanks to all of you
and that higher power. Amen?

1413
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:01,757
- Amen.
- Amen.

1414
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,928
Jerry, you about ready to share?

1415
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,229
Come on, y'all,
let's give it up for Jerry.

1416
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,319
- My name is Jerry.
- Hi, Jerry.

1417
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:26,824
The slight scent of weed. Chilli.
He thinks he's caught me off guard.

1418
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,329
Oh, my God!
I've caught him off guard.

1419
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,506
He rushes in from behind.

1420
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,463
Idiot. I give him a wake-up call.

1421
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:47,265
Hazelnut coffee?
What kind of bitch drinks hazelnut?

1422
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:51,815
Holy! Chilli! Hit me!

1423
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,017
Get him!

1424
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:57,480
I'm going to trap him
and tag him in the face,

1425
01:07:57,991 --> 01:08:01,575
and yet, in my heart of hearts,
pretty sure it's not gonna work.

1426
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:07,327
Hoagie's attempts to face me fail
because he lacks confidence.

1427
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:10,242
Also, I think it's fair to say,

1428
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:14,296
I'm fucking surgical
with these complimentary donuts.

1429
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:21,803
And this is why
print journalism is dying.

1430
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:28,097
Yes! This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

1431
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,638
I'm going to be the one who tags Jerry.

1432
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,193
Callahan will become distracted
by his own arrogant thoughts,

1433
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:39,983
which I will exploit.

1434
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,614
This will be my victory,

1435
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:44,238
which makes sense
because success breeds success...

1436
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:46,153
Oh, God.

1437
01:08:57,550 --> 01:09:02,545
How come "bi-weekly" means both
twice a week and every other week?

1438
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:06,556
That's mad confusing
and it's just linguistically lazy.

1439
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:13,764
Oh, shit!

1440
01:09:25,495 --> 01:09:27,077
- Holy shit!
- Excessive.

1441
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,212
Feeling trapped, Jerry?

1442
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:39,797
No.

1443
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,957
Nice.

1444
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,170
Holy shit!

1445
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:48,382
No, no, no!

1446
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:52,181
No, no, no!

1447
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,304
We got you, Jerry! You're trapped!

1448
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:57,474
Five hours till your wedding!
We can wait it out if you can!

1449
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:15,917
Shit. You know what I just realized?

1450
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:18,328
There's a lot of sacramental wine
and wafers in there.

1451
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:19,667
He could survive for quite a while.

1452
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,002
No, he can't drink.

1453
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:23,257
- Yeah, but it's not real wine.
- Yes, it is.

1454
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:24,884
It's just grape juice. It's not wine.

1455
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:28,763
I mean, I was once so fucked up
that I took a shit in my niece's crib.

1456
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,425
- Oh.
- Twice, if you ask my sister-in-law.

1457
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:33,593
So how long you been sober?

1458
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:35,887
Oh, no, I'm not sober.
I'm high right now.

1459
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:37,393
I'm just here to tag my friend.

1460
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:41,731
Good luck with the sobriety, man.
That's cool. Definitely.

1461
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:43,815
It's awful quiet in there.

1462
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,026
You know what he's doing?
It's a classic ruse.

1463
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,908
Make them think there's an exit
and he already escaped. Not buying it.

1464
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,035
I buy it. I bet he has a secret door
back there.

1465
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,196
Refrigerator turns into an elevator.

1466
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:54,281
What?

1467
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,537
Takes the elevator down to the basement.
That's his lair.

1468
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,334
- Different outfits, computer screens.
- What are you talking about?

1469
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,628
- Cameras watching us.
- He's not Batman.

1470
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,132
Told you. In there.

1471
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:06,384
What's it say?

1472
01:11:07,722 --> 01:11:10,840
- "Eat my dick."
- "Eat my dick." "Balls." "Ass"?

1473
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,052
"Butt."

1474
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:13,178
"Ice cream."

1475
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,259
- What?
- What?

1476
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,804
Yeah, he's taunting me.
He knows I'm lactose intolerant.

1477
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,891
What is going on? Where is he?

1478
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,651
Where is he?

1479
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,821
Jerry?

1480
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:33,987
We're supposed to be getting
our wedding photos done in an hour.

1481
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,446
What are you doing?

1482
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,332
- Come on out, Jerry.
- Jerry, you can come out.

1483
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:38,537
We're not gonna get you, Jerry.

1484
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,247
Babe, look, calm down.
Look, I'm sorry.

1485
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,583
Shut up, Jerry.
I can't fucking take this, Jerry.

1486
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:44,122
She can't take it. Come on out.

1487
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,507
Honey, why are you playing this game
right now?

1488
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:48,710
Why are you playing this game
with your friends right now?

1489
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,762
Why is he playing this game right now?

1490
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:52,843
Hey, babe, look.
You gotta calm down, okay?

1491
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:54,550
Listen to me! It's very hard

1492
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,890
because you have decided
to ruin everything.

1493
01:11:58,064 --> 01:12:00,146
And so have you.

1494
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,274
With your stupid face,
and your stupid beard,

1495
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,060
and your stupid glasses,

1496
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:07,024
and that stupid jumpsuit.

1497
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:10,027
There's only so much
a girl can take,

1498
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:12,909
and then you want me
on top of that, just to...

1499
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:17,322
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1500
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,743
- Babe? Suz? Sue?
- Jerry. Oh, my God.

1501
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,710
- Boo? Boo-boo?
- Sue?

1502
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:24,587
Boo-boo? Boo-boo?

1503
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:26,168
What happened? Wait, wait, wait.
What happened?

1504
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:27,332
Susan, are you okay?

1505
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,342
- Sit down, sit down, sit down.
- It's the baby. It's the baby.

1506
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,469
It's finally happening. He's right here.
Who's it? Bob, tag him.

1507
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:32,800
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

1508
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:33,964
There's something wrong with her baby.

1509
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,848
There's nothing wrong with that baby.
It's a fake.

1510
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,508
If you won't do it, then tag me.
I'm gonna do it.

1511
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:39,519
Oh, yeah. Fine.
You want me to tag you, then?

1512
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:40,975
Oops, I missed.

1513
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,309
As usual, you're completely wrong.

1514
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,440
This? You think I'm wrong?
This is so over the top!

1515
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,771
This is obvious.

1516
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:49,145
Tag me, and I'll give him a hug.

1517
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,654
And I'll say,
"if she's having a miscarriage,

1518
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:52,072
"this is awful, and you're it."

1519
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,196
Are you kidding me right now?

1520
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,486
You know what? This feels like a scene
from What Would You Do?

1521
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:58,996
You get put in a precarious situation,

1522
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:01,077
and you have to make the right decision.

1523
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:02,287
It's all actors and cameras.

1524
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:06,170
It's not great television,
but it hooks me in.

1525
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,330
What?

1526
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:08,790
Come on.

1527
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:10,458
All right, we're good.
We're gonna get to the hospital.

1528
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:15,676
Jesus. Hey! Jerry? Jerry, if you need
anything I could easily...

1529
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:17,256
You come near her or my baby,

1530
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:18,846
I'll crush your windpipe, Bob.

1531
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:22,179
This ain't no fucking game.

1532
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:27,851
Uh...

1533
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:29,435
I'm pretty sure it's real, guys.

1534
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:32,732
I will be so pissed
if she didn't have a miscarriage.

1535
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:33,899
Chilli!

1536
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:35,317
We all would be.

1537
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:36,859
- It's just a thing you don't...
- Say.

1538
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:38,369
It's implied.

1539
01:13:58,643 --> 01:14:00,725
Hey, Linda. Namaste.

1540
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:04,896
Shouldn't you boys be getting cleaned up
for the wedding?

1541
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,228
Not you, Chilli.
You're perfect.

1542
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,229
Thanks, Linda.

1543
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,360
I don't think
anybody's gonna be freshening up.

1544
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,566
Hoagie, you can't go looking like that.

1545
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:23,532
"To everyone asking,
the wedding has been postponed.

1546
01:14:23,709 --> 01:14:25,746
"Thank you for your thoughts
and prayers."

1547
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,160
It's from Jerry's mom.

1548
01:14:27,505 --> 01:14:30,247
- Well, maybe we're bad people.
- Maybe?

1549
01:14:30,424 --> 01:14:32,006
Yes, I think we definitely are.

1550
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:33,083
We might be.

1551
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:36,636
Tag used to be a thing
that made me really happy.

1552
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:40,261
But now, it's destroying me. I feel sad.

1553
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:41,765
Shut the fuck up, Sable.

1554
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:44,928
Has anyone seen
the bridesmaids' Instagram stories?

1555
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,598
Check it out.

1556
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:51,522
"Wedding's canceled."
Sad face emoji.

1557
01:14:51,696 --> 01:14:54,313
"I can't wear the dress.
Such a pretty dress.

1558
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,401
"So sad." Goodbye emoji. “Was it a..."

1559
01:14:56,575 --> 01:15:00,159
Really? ls there any chance
that all these women could post banal,

1560
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,445
minute-by-minute moments from their day,

1561
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,656
with mind-numbing captions
at the same time?

1562
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:06,666
- Totally.
- Absolutely. That's all Instagram is.

1563
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,119
- Yeah.
- I don't know about this, guys.

1564
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:11,663
It doesn't feel right. I smell a rat.

1565
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:12,792
That's what I've been saying.

1566
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:13,873
I have been actually saying this
the whole time.

1567
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:17,715
Hey, sweetheart, can we just move on?
It's over.

1568
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:19,720
But it's not. Now, come on, guys.

1569
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:21,339
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

1570
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,007
- Bob.
- What'd I do?

1571
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,266
Can I take a photograph of you?

1572
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:25,802
No. Okay.

1573
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:26,886
Cute.

1574
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:28,596
I'm gonna set up
an Instagram account for you.

1575
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:29,764
Please don't.

1576
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,392
Rachel Ditmus is the only bridesmaid
with a private Instagram account.

1577
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:34,811
She's been wanting you to finger bang
her since the sixth grade.

1578
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:38,114
If anybody's stupid enough
to fall for our request,

1579
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,817
it will be that dum-dum.

1580
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:44,029
And sent.
All we've got to do now is wait.

1581
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:46,285
And accepted!

1582
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:47,915
- Really?
- That was weirdly fast.

1583
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:49,325
Do not finger bang her.

1584
01:15:49,503 --> 01:15:52,245
Oh, my God. I was right.

1585
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:54,539
- What? What are we looking at here?
- What the hell is this?

1586
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:55,798
A wedding dress.

1587
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:56,958
What the fuck?

1588
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:58,918
They faked the fucking miscarriage!

1589
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,508
No, no, no. Jerry's going down.
We're gonna destroy that wedding.

1590
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,343
- Let's go!
- This is bullshit. That is so fucked up.

1591
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:04,507
Absolutely.

1592
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:08,928
Hoagie?

1593
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:12,598
Hoagie, what are you doing?

1594
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,063
Damn it!

1595
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:16,106
- Sweetie.
- Hoagie?

1596
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,611
Be careful.

1597
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,156
Should we stop him, or...

1598
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:22,533
I'm not getting near him.
He's swinging that bat around.

1599
01:16:25,206 --> 01:16:27,197
- Sweetie, that's your mom's.
- Yeah, you're gonna hurt yourself.

1600
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:40,965
We lost! He beat us! The game is over!

1601
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:44,381
We can't tag Jerry.

1602
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:49,515
It's just time for us to come to terms
with that. He's untouchable. That's it.

1603
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,270
What do you wanna do?
You wanna just give up?

1604
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,932
Yeah, Bob. I wanna give up.
It's time to give up.

1605
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,692
Come on, Hogan. You're not a quitter.

1606
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:57,192
What's the alternative?

1607
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:00,192
We go to the wedding.
We try to tag him. We fail.

1608
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,273
And we fuck up the wedding?

1609
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:03,858
That's not a cool move.
That's a dick move.

1610
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,572
That's not what friends do.
That's what assholes do.

1611
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:08,534
Hoagie! He faked a fucking miscarriage.

1612
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:10,789
This is a miscarriage of justice.

1613
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,167
This is where we get him.

1614
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:14,543
He deserves to pay for that.

1615
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:17,754
Even if we wanted to do that,
we all signed an amendment.

1616
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:21,168
Amendments are null and void
if you fake a miscarriage.

1617
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:22,881
That's just basic contract law.

1618
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,637
- That's law. Basic contract law.
- Law.

1619
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:25,797
Like he said.

1620
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:28,262
- I literally said exactly that.
- I know. We're saying it together.

1621
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:31,769
But I was also right earlier
because I said the miscarriage was fake.

1622
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:35,975
The amendment stands,
and maybe that's a good thing.

1623
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,477
Maybe it's time to grow up a little.

1624
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:41,775
- Uh...
- I'm going to the wedding.

1625
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:46,948
And you guys can do what you want.
I hope you come too.

1626
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,953
Chilli, just put on a tie.

1627
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:53,411
Sweetie.

1628
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:58,295
Do you even have a tie?

1629
01:17:58,465 --> 01:17:59,626
Yes, I have a tie.

1630
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,424
- Do you need to borrow a tie?
- Yes, I need to borrow a tie.

1631
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:02,500
Okay.

1632
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:47,758
Hi! I'm so glad you made it!

1633
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,088
Is that champagne?

1634
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:51,220
I know. Ugh.

1635
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:53,351
I'm the girl who cried miscarriage.

1636
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,854
But I had to get him out of that room
and distract you for a couple of hours

1637
01:18:57,024 --> 01:18:58,480
so that the amendment could kick in.

1638
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:00,267
Wait. Are you even pregnant?

1639
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:01,772
No, I was never pregnant.

1640
01:19:01,946 --> 01:19:03,061
You were never pregnant?

1641
01:19:03,155 --> 01:19:04,270
Whoa.

1642
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,855
Just listen. Jerry knew

1643
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:07,819
that you guys might get the drop on him

1644
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:10,701
so "Operation Miscarriage"
was our fail-safe.

1645
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:13,033
- It was an operation?
- It was actually my idea.

1646
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:14,739
- Brilliant. Brilliant!
- Ah, thanks.

1647
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:16,078
That's diabolical.

1648
01:19:16,252 --> 01:19:19,244
Everyone's just pissed because you won,
and they're boys.

1649
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:22,626
They can't get pregnant,
so they can't fake a miscarriage.

1650
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,169
It's true.

1651
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:26,550
Look, I'm not saying I want you
to have a miscarriage.

1652
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,710
Then don't.

1653
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:31,051
'Cause that would be terrible.
But if you ever do have a miscarriage,

1654
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:33,762
I don't wanna say that you would
deserve it 'cause that's too far,

1655
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:36,303
but what I will say and what I do feel

1656
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,437
is that's what you get.

1657
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:42,066
Okay. It's fine.
We can all have different feelings.

1658
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,814
But it's our wedding day, you guys.
Come on.

1659
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:47,105
And we came up with this great amendment

1660
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:51,902
so that we could all enjoy this day
together and have fun and relax.

1661
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:53,160
Are we cool?

1662
01:19:53,872 --> 01:19:55,863
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Not yet.

1663
01:19:56,250 --> 01:20:00,665
Sorry. Not cool yet.
It's just, you did murder a child.

1664
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:01,744
No.

1665
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:02,874
She didn't.
No, it was a fake miscarriage.

1666
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,915
Yeah, not the imaginary child
that was inside of you,

1667
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:09,836
but the actual inner child
that lives inside of me

1668
01:20:10,014 --> 01:20:11,254
got decapitated.

1669
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:15,805
Head flew up, did flips in the air,
blood spurting everywhere.

1670
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:19,471
Hoagie, Jerry has a perfect record,

1671
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:21,104
and we're a team now.

1672
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:22,682
The winning team.

1673
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:25,602
And I just feel like, Hoagie,
if you're gonna play

1674
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:28,942
a children's game as a grown man,

1675
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:31,858
maybe, next time,
don't play like a child.

1676
01:20:33,912 --> 01:20:37,496
Anyways, I am really excited
you guys are here.

1677
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,203
Try the raw bar. It's off the hook.

1678
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:42,493
It's my wedding!
I'm getting married!

1679
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,288
- Congratulations.
- Come on! Grab it!

1680
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:52,837
I take back everything I said
about her being effervescent.

1681
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:55,431
I met Jerry in AA.

1682
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:58,514
You see, people,
I got a lot of problems.

1683
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:03,727
Anger issues. I left my wife.
I have many kids.

1684
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:07,144
And this man
got me to turn to the cloth.

1685
01:21:07,321 --> 01:21:09,107
It was a low point in my life.

1686
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:11,443
There was jail time involved.

1687
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,824
I briefly converted to Islam.

1688
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:18,238
I lost a long legal battle
with Jo-Ann Fabrics.

1689
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:21,658
During that time, I got to know
Jerry and Susan as a couple.

1690
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:22,950
And that is a true blessing.

1691
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,540
What's the difference between
Episcopalian and Lutheran?

1692
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,172
Episcopalians don't eat fish.

1693
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:33,007
That's pescatarian.
That's not a religion.

1694
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:34,841
They're all fanatics. I don't know.

1695
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:38,432
Remind me again, is it on the kiss
or after they walk back down the aisle?

1696
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:41,344
Seriously?
You said you'd worked weddings before.

1697
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:45,436
The kiss, the doves, end of ceremony.
The groom was very specific about this.

1698
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:48,317
...and finds new ways
of expressing love

1699
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:51,271
through the ups and downs of life.

1700
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:54,816
Susan, do you take Jerry
to be your husband?

1701
01:21:55,536 --> 01:21:57,994
Do you promise to love, honor,
cherish and protect him,

1702
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:02,157
forsaking all others,
holding only to him forever more?

1703
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:03,916
I do.

1704
01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:05,076
Beautiful.

1705
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,086
There's gonna be a window.

1706
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,247
- What, sweetie?
- The doves.

1707
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:11,378
What about the doves?

1708
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,209
There's an opening.

1709
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,378
Just relax, honey.

1710
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:17,759
You seem stressed.

1711
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:21,634
Jerry, do you take Susan
to be your wife?

1712
01:22:22,688 --> 01:22:25,726
Do you promise to love, honor, cherish,
and protect her

1713
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:30,018
forsaking all others,
holding only to her forever more?

1714
01:22:30,112 --> 01:22:31,318
I do.

1715
01:22:31,488 --> 01:22:33,274
I mean, this is actually
kind of beautiful.

1716
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,281
It really is, man.

1717
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:38,029
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1718
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:41,616
You may kiss the bride.

1719
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:43,455
I love you.

1720
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,286
- Hoagie!
- Go, go, go!

1721
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:32,671
- Oh, God! Guys, go!
- Hoagie! You okay?

1722
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,127
Jesus.

1723
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:35,708
Hey, man.

1724
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,168
Buddy?

1725
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:39,090
- You scared away the swans.
- Hoagie?

1726
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:41,714
- Hogan? Hogan.
- Hoagie!

1727
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:44,224
I can't believe that you guys did this.
Right now.

1728
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:47,557
Well, I don't think you get to claim
the moral high ground over us, actually.

1729
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:48,812
Yeah, you're not better than us.

1730
01:23:48,982 --> 01:23:50,768
You and your wife pretended
to have a goddamn miscarriage.

1731
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:52,684
Misunderstanding! Misunderstanding.

1732
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:55,068
- Misunderstanding.
- In her vagina.

1733
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:56,729
Wow. Oh, boy.

1734
01:23:56,907 --> 01:23:58,272
Guys, call a doctor!

1735
01:23:58,450 --> 01:23:59,861
- Can you hear me?
- Buddy?

1736
01:24:00,244 --> 01:24:01,905
- Hey!
- Somebody get a doctor!

1737
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:04,446
- Bud?
- He's gone full loss of consciousness.

1738
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:05,988
That's impressive.

1739
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:07,907
Even better
than your performance. Right?

1740
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,742
I know! It's so good!

1741
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:11,911
Excuse me, uh, everyone...

1742
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:13,620
Everything's fine.

1743
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:15,548
Uh, this is all just a game.

1744
01:24:18,512 --> 01:24:20,469
He's still unconscious, but he's stable.

1745
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,381
He really should never have been
this active given his condition.

1746
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:25,516
- You can see him when he wakes up.
- Thanks.

1747
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:28,515
I got this.

1748
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:31,306
Excuse me, Doctor. Hey, how are you?

1749
01:24:31,483 --> 01:24:34,521
- Yeah.
- Doctor, uh... Doctor Yoon, is it?

1750
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:36,060
- Yes.
- How do you spell that?

1751
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:39,777
- You're looking right at it.
- I know, but I'm just asking you.

1752
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:41,570
What exactly are you asking me?

1753
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:44,444
My friends and I do this thing.
It's this really weird game.

1754
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,029
Is there any chance this is all fake,
that you could just tell me.

1755
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,914
I won't tell the others.

1756
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,332
Is this fake?

1757
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,827
- This hospital?
- The whole thing, yeah. Is it fake?

1758
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:54,291
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

1759
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:56,042
He told you to say that, right?

1760
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:58,833
- Look, I gotta prep a surgery.
- Will you just do me one quick favor?

1761
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:01,093
Could you recite
the Hippocratic Oath for me?

1762
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:02,879
That's not a thing doctors memorize.

1763
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:07,391
Still unsure.

1764
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:09,643
It's gonna be fine.
It's just, it was a lot.

1765
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,224
I mean, how does that all happen
at a wedding?

1766
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:13,306
Hey, boss.

1767
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:15,016
How did that go?

1768
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:16,479
I'm all turned around.

1769
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:17,643
About what?

1770
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:20,066
If he's an actor or if he's not.

1771
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:23,358
He's not. He's a doctor.
We're in a hospital.

1772
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:27,115
You're drinking the Kool-Aid.

1773
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,203
All right. What do we do?

1774
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,839
Look, Chilli, what's wrong with you?
Just go talk to the girl.

1775
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:39,999
Could be a trap.

1776
01:25:40,093 --> 01:25:42,630
She's here for a friend
who is in the hospital. Okay?

1777
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:44,878
You know I'm right. I'm always right.

1778
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:47,890
Okay, you're right about this,
but you are not always right.

1779
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,346
Buddy, I'm always right,
and you know it's true.

1780
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:50,426
Bob, you're not always right.

1781
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,885
- 100%...
- 1989.

1782
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:53,262
Oh, come on.

1783
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,477
Ken Griffey Jr. enters the league,
and what do you say?

1784
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:57,016
"He will never be
as good as his father."

1785
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:58,400
And he's better than his father.

1786
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,777
- Where are the rings?
- You are so wrong!

1787
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:03,484
The historical record
has proven that I am right.

1788
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:05,866
You know what? Time will tell.

1789
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,740
You will never admit
that you are wrong about anything.

1790
01:26:08,914 --> 01:26:10,154
I'm not wrong.

1791
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:12,243
Come on, it's been a while
since we've done this.

1792
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,452
Come here, man.

1793
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:15,826
This was a fun few days, man.

1794
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,369
- I really missed you.
- I missed you too, man.

1795
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:20,372
- You want a breath mint?
- No, I don't want a breath mint.

1796
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,756
- Stop it.
- You want a breath mint?

1797
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:24,801
I would love a breath mint.
I got a gross taste in my mouth.

1798
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,052
Hey, mind if I sit?

1799
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:34,220
No.

1800
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:37,848
Thanks for coming.

1801
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:40,939
- I hope he's okay.
- Yeah, me too.

1802
01:26:44,783 --> 01:26:45,989
Um...

1803
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:55,875
I don't know if that...
We're in a hospital and...

1804
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,409
- You know?
- Yes.

1805
01:26:57,587 --> 01:27:00,295
My friend is possibly dying.

1806
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:04,299
But it feels like a time I need
to tell you how I feel about you,

1807
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:07,302
and I am so pumped
that your husband's dead.

1808
01:27:07,723 --> 01:27:09,054
- No.
- No.

1809
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:12,433
But I'm really happy to see you, Cheryl.

1810
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:17,396
You are broke and divorced

1811
01:27:17,566 --> 01:27:19,933
- and just a fucking mess, really.
- Yeah.

1812
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:21,350
But it's fun to see you, too.

1813
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:23,565
Good. All right. I'll take that.

1814
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:26,982
I actually think that...

1815
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:30,072
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I would see you again.

1816
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:32,862
- For real?
- Yeah.

1817
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:35,076
- Like a little date.
- No, definitely didn't say that.

1818
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:37,287
- Like a dinner.
- Smaller than that.

1819
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:39,580
- Like a lunch.
- How about a snack?

1820
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:42,713
I'll take what I can get.

1821
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:46,000
Hoagie, I know you're fucking with me.

1822
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:52,591
I'm not. I've got a tumor on my liver
the size of my right nut.

1823
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:56,386
Jesus.

1824
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:57,970
Yeah.

1825
01:27:58,148 --> 01:28:00,856
I know you're fucking with him,
but what are you doing? What's the plan?

1826
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:03,518
- Tell us what's going on.
- Chilli, there's no plan.

1827
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:04,901
What's going on?

1828
01:28:05,071 --> 01:28:06,607
There's no plan, Chilli.

1829
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,196
Stop winking at me.

1830
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:10,073
Think it's real.
This looks like it's doing something.

1831
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:12,780
Something real is happening
on this thing right here.

1832
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:14,157
How long have you known this?

1833
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:15,571
For three weeks.

1834
01:28:15,749 --> 01:28:17,080
Three weeks.

1835
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:20,618
Right nut.
Too specific, I call bullshit.

1836
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:22,286
That's a lie. Right? It's a lie.

1837
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:23,454
I'm not lying.

1838
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,923
Although I did lie about one thing.

1839
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,710
Jerry's not quitting
at the end of the season.

1840
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:31,424
What? Why the fuck would I quit?

1841
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:33,054
Yeah, I just... I said that

1842
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:36,183
to get everyone together,
you know, for one last round.

1843
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:39,186
Hoagie, tell me you are fucking joking
about this.

1844
01:28:39,356 --> 01:28:40,596
Uh, no.

1845
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:47,820
There is a decent chance
I will not be around for next season.

1846
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:57,655
Damn.

1847
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:02,292
And, I mean, plus,
even if you were, you'd be,

1848
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:05,663
you know. Really slow.

1849
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:07,589
A total sitting duck.

1850
01:29:07,676 --> 01:29:10,464
Carrying like an IV bag around,
that's easy.

1851
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:11,840
I had an uncle that went through chemo,

1852
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:13,841
and afterwards,
he was terrible at games.

1853
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:17,008
But I guess that makes sense.
It would be weird if he got better.

1854
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,676
Then everybody would be getting chemo.

1855
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:24,348
I love you guys.

1856
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:28,485
I love... I love this game. You know?

1857
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:32,781
I don't know what it is.
It just brings out the best in us.

1858
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:35,947
Except today.

1859
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:38,950
Today, I don't know.

1860
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:44,209
I really fucked up your wedding, Jerry,
and I am super sorry.

1861
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:46,412
Jerry?

1862
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:49,832
- Has he hung up?
- Jerry?

1863
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:57,722
You didn't fuck up my wedding, Hoagie.
Come on.

1864
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,351
- Right?
- No.

1865
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:02,849
You might have ruined a moment.

1866
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:06,728
I screwed it up.
You should've been up there with me.

1867
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:07,892
All you boys should've.

1868
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:09,935
That's my fault.

1869
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:14,148
I always thought that you guys were just
much closer to each other than to me...

1870
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:15,232
What?

1871
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:17,576
I mean, if it seems like we were closer,

1872
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:20,245
it's only because
we're physically closer

1873
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:21,655
because you always ran away.

1874
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,323
Successfully. You know, I mean,

1875
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,492
not for nothing, you might actually be

1876
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:27,703
the very best person at this game
on the planet.

1877
01:30:28,089 --> 01:30:29,705
He might be, right?

1878
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:32,082
Yeah, you're really good at tag.

1879
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:35,841
Yes, but you've kind of missed
the point.

1880
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:39,177
I mean, it's not about trying
to get away from each other.

1881
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:44,262
It's actually about having a reason
to be around each other. You know?

1882
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:45,600
Yeah.

1883
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:47,893
I mean, Ben Franklin said it best.
Am I right?

1884
01:30:48,068 --> 01:30:50,651
"We don't stop playing
'cause we grow old..."

1885
01:30:50,737 --> 01:30:52,273
"We grow old
because we stop playing."

1886
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,277
I've been wanting to say for a few years
that quote is not Benjamin Franklin.

1887
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:57,358
That is German anthropologist,
Karl Groos.

1888
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:59,443
- La, la, la, la, la...
- Why are you ruining the moment?

1889
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:00,702
- I just don't even want to know.
- He's in the hospital.

1890
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:02,746
- It felt like the right moment.
- It's not the right moment, so...

1891
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:03,867
- It is the right moment.
- It isn't.

1892
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:05,077
So, Jerry, uh...

1893
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:10,291
It's 11:55.

1894
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:13,082
Get in here, and let me tag you.

1895
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:19,346
You know, I've been so attached,
I suppose,

1896
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:21,093
to my perfect record all these years,

1897
01:31:21,184 --> 01:31:22,970
dominating you fools.

1898
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:25,932
Maybe I should. Maybe I shouldn't.

1899
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:29,064
If you think about it,
Jerry is a tag virgin.

1900
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:30,436
Or champion.

1901
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:32,564
Just let us deflower you.

1902
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:34,068
We'll be gentle.

1903
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,154
I can't.

1904
01:31:38,034 --> 01:31:39,024
Come on.

1905
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:41,694
I can't do it.

1906
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:45,622
Then I'm not gonna tag anybody,
and the game ends with me.

1907
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:46,995
That's dark.

1908
01:31:47,085 --> 01:31:49,452
Or you just let me tag you.

1909
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,501
All right, fuck it.

1910
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:01,005
- It!
- Oh, my God!

1911
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:02,305
Loser! Loser!

1912
01:32:02,392 --> 01:32:03,678
You suck!

1913
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:05,634
Awesome.

1914
01:32:07,105 --> 01:32:09,722
- Yes!
- You officially suck.

1915
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:10,897
Oh, you're so it!

1916
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:13,229
Goddamn! All right!

1917
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,728
I love you guys.

1918
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:18,947
Love you too, man.

1919
01:32:22,996 --> 01:32:26,614
You know we got five minutes
left of May.

1920
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,374
I ain't gonna be last it. Bitches!

1921
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:49,977
Look, Bob!
Where are you gonna go, Bob?

1922
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:51,138
No!

1923
01:32:57,072 --> 01:32:59,564
Verbal amendment?
That women should be playing.

1924
01:33:01,034 --> 01:33:03,196
- Amendment.
- Yeah, amendment.

1925
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:05,444
Oh.

1926
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:07,529
Oh, you just made a big mistake.

1927
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:11,909
- You're it, bitch!
- You're it now!

1928
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:13,293
- You're going down!
- You're too intense!

1929
01:33:13,463 --> 01:33:15,329
You're gonna suck my tiny ginger balls.

1930
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:16,838
Oh! Gross!

1931
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:19,375
You're gross!

1932
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,476
Come on! Shit! No.

1933
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:37,813
- You're it.
- No, I can't get involved in the story.

1934
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:38,985
We made an amendment!

1935
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:41,939
Come on, it's a little bit fun, right?
You have about three minutes.

1936
01:33:55,588 --> 01:33:58,706
Sable! Come on.
Where are your ethics, buddy?

1937
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:01,670
Come on. Just reach out.

1938
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:02,835
- SUSAN; No!
- You got it.

1939
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:05,337
Oh, shit, hang on a second.

1940
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:06,721
You Okay?

1941
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:08,473
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1942
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:11,593
You're it!

1943
01:34:48,766 --> 01:34:50,723
Tag, brother!

1944
01:34:52,937 --> 01:34:54,974
You're it!

1945
01:34:55,148 --> 01:34:56,934
- I'm it?
- You're it?

1946
01:34:57,859 --> 01:34:59,145
Now you're it.

1947
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:01,686
You got me. No way!

1948
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:06,607
- Not bad, huh'? Pretty hot?
- Wow.

1949
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:19,123
You're it!

1950
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:23,252
Yeah, baby.

1951
01:35:25,094 --> 01:35:27,631
Hey, fucker. You're it!

1952
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:31,382
You're it! Yeah!

1953
01:35:32,644 --> 01:35:34,055
You're it, baby!

1954
01:37:31,763 --> 01:37:36,849
Once, there was a kid who

1955
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:41,512
Got into an accident
and couldn't come to school

1956
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:47,435
But when he finally came back

1957
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:54,325
His hair turned
from black into bright white

1958
01:37:56,537 --> 01:37:59,950
He said that it was from when the cars

1959
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:05,335
Had smashed him so hard

1960
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:11,300
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

1961
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:16,388
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

1962
01:38:16,849 --> 01:38:21,719
Once, there was this girl who

1963
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:26,936
Wouldn't go and change
with the girls in the change room

1964
01:38:27,110 --> 01:38:32,355
But when they finally made her

1965
01:38:32,532 --> 01:38:38,904
They saw red marks all over her body

1966
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:44,245
She couldn't quite explain it

1967
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:50,586
They'd always just been there

1968
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:53,675
- Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
- Baa, baa, baa, baa

1969
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:56,549
- Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
- Baa, baa, baa, baa

1970
01:38:56,681 --> 01:38:59,639
Ooh

1971
01:38:59,725 --> 01:39:01,341
Yeah

1972
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:06,559
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

1973
01:39:06,649 --> 01:39:11,359
Mmm, mmm

1974
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:17,240
Both the girl and the boy were glad

1975
01:39:17,994 --> 01:39:23,364
'Cause one kid had it worse than that

1976
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:32,999
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

1977
01:39:33,092 --> 01:39:38,053
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

1978
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:40,923
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

1979
01:39:41,017 --> 01:39:45,181
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey

1980
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:54,149
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1981
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:59,192
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

1982
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:04,158
- You're it.
- Fucked
